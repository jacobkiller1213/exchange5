<p>It&#8217;s exactly what you&#8217;d expect from a European digital bank, lots of rules, lots of regulations, and a world of bureaucracy! But, making a Revolut money transfer can be easy if you know the right platform. </p>



<p>For the most part, this post is a full guide on how to send money to a Revolut account instantly without having to sign up anywhere. And believe me, a simple task of sending funds to an account will be difficult without CoinCannon. </p>



<p>It will take a few minutes, so get started now!</p>



<div class="wp-block-buttons is-content-justification-center is-layout-flex wp-container-core-buttons-is-layout-1 wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex">
<div class="wp-block-button has-custom-width wp-block-button__width-100 is-style-outline is-style-outline--1"><a class="wp-block-button__link has-black-color has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-text-color has-background has-link-color wp-element-button" href="https://hi.exchange/En?cur_from=USDTTRC20&amp;cur_to=Revolut"><strong>Transfer Money to Revolut!</strong></a></div>
</div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-revolut-and-why-would-i-need-it">What is Revolut and Why Would I Need it?</h2>



<p>This ain&#8217;t you 2010&#8217;s blog post with 4000 words ðŸ™‚ so I will just cut it down to the basics! Basically, Revolut is simply a digital bank based in the UK. They have had a massive success over the past few years as a replacement for physical banks. You can have your own virtual card from Revolut and use it for online payments or use it when you&#8217;re traveling. </p>



<p>Now, since I&#8217;m not on the Revolut marketing team (yo Revolut marketing, hit me up if you&#8217;re interested), my honest opinion about them is that it is at best a mediocre digital banking solution mostly suited for Europeans. What they have to offer is good currency exchange rates. But, there are better options out there. Nonetheless, its popularity and the free subscription (for the basic plan) means that lots of people will sign up for a revolut account and card.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-to-make-a-revolut-money-transfer">How to Make a Revolut Money Transfer?</h2>



<p>If you don&#8217;t have a Revolut account, making the transfer has to be done via another bank. In such case, you will not be able to transfer cryptocurrencies to your account. However, with CoinCannon, making the Revolut money transfer is instant and easy. Here&#8217;s how it works:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>You select Tether USDT and Revolut EUR on the exchange box</li>



<li>Send us the destination Revolut address iBAN, account holder name and email address</li>



<li>You send USDT to CoinCannon&#8217;s wallet</li>



<li>CoinCannon will send funds to the designated Revolut address</li>
</ol>



<p>By using CoinCannon, there is no need for a bank account, or signing up on any platform. The process is instant and regardless of where you live, you can still make Revolut money transfers. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-common-questions-about-revolut">Common Questions about Revolut</h2>



<p><strong>1. How secure is Revolut for online transactions?</strong></p>



<p>Revolut uses advanced security features like biometric authentication, disposable virtual cards, and real-time fraud detection to protect your transactions.</p>



<p><strong>2. Does Revolut support cryptocurrency transactions?</strong></p>



<p>Yes, Revolut allows users to buy, sell, and hold cryptocurrencies, but direct withdrawals to external wallets are limited.</p>



<p><strong>3. How can I add money to my Revolut account?</strong></p>



<p>You can fund your Revolut account via bank transfer, debit/credit card, Apple Pay, Google Pay, or supported e-wallets.</p>



<p><strong>4. Can I exchange USDT to Revolut?</strong></p>



<p>Yes, you can exchange USDT to Revolut using third-party platforms like CoinCannon, as Revolut does not natively support USDT deposits.</p>



<p><strong>5. Are there fees for exchanging USDT to Revolut?</strong></p>



<p>Fees depend on the exchange platform; CoinCannon offers competitive rates with no hidden charges for USDT to Revolut transfers.</p>



<p><strong>6. Do I need a verified Revolut account to receive USDT from CoinCannon?</strong></p>



<p>Yes, your Revolut account must be verified to receive fiat currency after converting USDT through CoinCannon</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re reading this blog post, it means that you need to purchase something online or register somewhere but don&#8217;t have a debit card to use. Obviously, a virtual debit card is the answer right? No! a virtual debit card is not necessarily the best solution for your needs simply because you will have to pay a lot more fees. let&#8217;s face it, there is no such thing as a free debit card. Instead, you will have have to pay a whole lot of extra fees for a virtual debit card that is a pain in the bottom area! On top of that, you have to fill out forms, wait for confirmation, give out all your personal information and worry about the card declining! </p>



<p>So what if I told you that there&#8217;s a totally better option? With zero extra fees, and it comes instantly with no sign up, how about that? </p>



<p><strong>With CoinCannon Online Payments, you can pay with 100+ currencies including crypto and e-currencies, and CoinCannon will use its own debit card to pay for you! </strong></p>



<p>By doing this, you can instantly pay for your purchase without paying any extra fees. You will have PayPal, Visa card and MasterCard payments anywhere on the vast expanse of web, anytime you need! </p>



<p>Ready to go? Click on the button below and get started!</p>



<p></p>



<div class="wp-block-buttons is-content-justification-center is-layout-flex wp-container-core-buttons-is-layout-2 wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex">

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-use-a-virtual-debit-card">Why use a virtual debit card?</h2>



<p>Depending on where you live and your life choices ðŸ™‚  you might not have a debit card! in that case, there comes a time where you need to purchase something online and they only take a handful of debit cards for payment. having a virtual debit card let&#8217;s you bypass all that regulatory shenanigan but at a cost! </p>



<p>there&#8217;s also another scenario in which you find yourself in need of a free debit card! And that&#8217;s when you&#8217;re going to register on a website or application and they ask for your card info! In such cases of presumptuous capitalist demand, do not give them what they ask for! I mean, if a presumably &#8220;free&#8221; website is asking for your debit card information, it will only mean that at some point, their customer journey is designed to bill you and take money (trust me, I&#8217;ve been in marketing for years!).</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-not-use-a-prepaid-debit-card">Why Not Use a Prepaid Debit Card?</h2>



<p>And now, you&#8217;re looking for a virtual debit card to get around the problem. But here&#8217;s a list of new problems that you&#8217;ll have:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Having to pay activation fee, purchase fee, exchange rate fee, third party markup fee!</li>



<li>A long process of purchasing your prepaid debit card</li>



<li>Sharing your personal information for a so called &#8220;free debit card&#8221;</li>



<li>Risking the purchase of a card that might not work! </li>



<li>Having to sign up on a sketchy website and believe me, they will send you promotional emails!</li>
</ul>



<p>After all, a virtual debit card is not exactly legit, is it?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-jolixo-has-to-offer">What CoinCannon has to Offer</h2>



<p>A better solution! here&#8217;s how it works:</p>



<p>You open <a href="http://www.hi.exchange/en">jolixo</a>, choose the currency you want to pay with</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-3 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="1024" height="275" data-id="8721" src="https://hi.exchange/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/virtual-debit-card-Free-Debit-Card-step-1-1024x275.png" alt="virtual debit card - free debit card " class="wp-image-8721" srcset="https://hi.exchange/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/virtual-debit-card-Free-Debit-Card-step-1-1024x275.png 1024w, https://hi.exchange/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/virtual-debit-card-Free-Debit-Card-step-1-300x81.png 300w, https://hi.exchange/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/virtual-debit-card-Free-Debit-Card-step-1-768x206.png 768w, https://hi.exchange/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/virtual-debit-card-Free-Debit-Card-step-1-1536x413.png 1536w, https://hi.exchange/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/virtual-debit-card-Free-Debit-Card-step-1.png 1895w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>
</figure>



<p>Then, select which debit card you need. we have Visa, MasterCard and PayPal. then, click on &#8220;next&#8221; to head to the second step.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img decoding="async" width="956" height="654" src="https://hi.exchange/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Virtual-debit-card-free-dibit-card-step-2.png" alt="virtual debit card - free debit card " class="wp-image-8722" srcset="https://hi.exchange/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Virtual-debit-card-free-dibit-card-step-2.png 956w, https://hi.exchange/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Virtual-debit-card-free-dibit-card-step-2-300x205.png 300w, https://hi.exchange/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Virtual-debit-card-free-dibit-card-step-2-768x525.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 956px) 100vw, 956px" /></figure></div>


<p>On the second step, share the purchase link, username and password for the account + any additional info. CoinCannon will automatically delete your account information after your transaction is done. However, make sure to change your password later.</p>



<p>click on &#8220;next&#8221; one more time to head to the third step. Here, you get a final chance to review your order. </p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img decoding="async" width="600" height="792" src="https://hi.exchange/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/virtual-debit-card-free-debit-card-step-3.png" alt="virtual debit card - free debit card " class="wp-image-8723" srcset="https://hi.exchange/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/virtual-debit-card-free-debit-card-step-3.png 600w, https://hi.exchange/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/virtual-debit-card-free-debit-card-step-3-227x300.png 227w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></figure></div>


<p>Remember, signing up on CoinCannon is not mandatory. But, CoinCannon offers various rewards for those who sign up! You will have discount codes, cashback and affiliate payments as a CoinCannon member. Ready to finish? head to the final step.</p>



<p>On the final step, you will need to make your payment. as you can see below, the CoinCannon wallet address is available to you. the payment settlement is automatic. As soon as you send your Payment, the transaction status will change to &#8220;processing&#8221;.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="603" height="817" src="https://hi.exchange/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/virtual-debit-card-free-debit-card-step-4.png" alt="prepaid debit card  " class="wp-image-8724" srcset="https://hi.exchange/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/virtual-debit-card-free-debit-card-step-4.png 603w, https://hi.exchange/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/virtual-debit-card-free-debit-card-step-4-221x300.png 221w" sizes="(max-width: 603px) 100vw, 603px" /></figure></div>

<p>What if I told you that you don&#8217;t need a credit card for online shopping? All you need is someone with a credit card to pay for you right? then, CoinCannon does the work for you!<br>At this point, you might think that you want a virtual prepaid credit card for online shopping but that&#8217;s complicated too. <strong>The alternative we offer is instant, anonymous and comes with much lower rates than a prepaid card</strong>. Here&#8217;s how it works.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>You want to buy something online that requires a credit card for online shopping.</li>



<li>You come to CoinCannon, send whatever currency you have like Tether USDT, Bitcoin or 100+ different currencies. Then you send us the link for your online shopping.</li>



<li>CoinCannon will go to the link and make the payment for you and send you the payment confirmation.</li>
</ul>



<p>Oh and by the way, it&#8217;s instant, with no KYC and comes with 24/7 support!</p>



<div class="wp-block-buttons is-content-justification-center is-layout-flex wp-container-core-buttons-is-layout-3 wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex">
<div class="wp-block-button"><a class="wp-block-button__link wp-element-button" href="https://hi.exchange/En/solutions/online-payment?cur_from=USDTTRC20&amp;cur_to=PPUSDI">Start Now!</a></div>
</div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-limitless-virtual-credit-card">The Limitless Virtual Credit Card </h2>



<p>It&#8217;s a pain in the bottom I tell ya! having to buy virtual credit card, going through all the different websites to find the best one, filling out the forms, paying all the extra money for a card you can only use once. Not to mention all the time you waste on purchasing a card for purchasing another thing on the internet! ain&#8217;t nobody got time for that! </p>



<p>Here&#8217;s what we do instead, we can be your cool friend who already has a credit card. All you gotta do is pay your buddy CoinCannon however you like and we&#8217;ll handle the payment stuff like a champ! </p>



<p>That way, you don&#8217;t have to waste time or money and the capitalism gods will be happy! </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-not-to-apply-for-an-online-credit-card-for-shopping">How not to Apply for an Online Credit Card for Shopping</h2>



<p>Honestly, purchasing a virtual credit card is a big hassle for all of us. If you live in a country where payments processors like PayPal, Visa or MasterCard do not provide services, then the trouble gets bigger! </p>



<p>But thanks to our frightening genius, your online purchases will have no limits and shall remain liberated from all the bounds of regulatory nightmare that consumes our ever-expanding financial limbo scattered around the vast expanse of the interweb! (the author has studied literature and wanted to showcase his poetic abilities with this paragraph!) </p>



<p>Whether you&#8217;re a freelancer or representing a business, having an quick and easy alternative for the expensive online credit card for shopping will give you a boost in performance. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-credit-card-fees-vs-jolixo-fees">Credit Card Fees Vs. CoinCannon Fees</h2>



<p>Here&#8217;s a quick look at the associated fees for a prepaid visa card:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Activation Fee</strong> â€“ Typically $3 to $10.</li>



<li><strong>Purchase Fee</strong> â€“ Some retailers charge an extra fee, usually around $5 to $15.</li>



<li><strong>Exchange Rate Fees</strong> â€“ If you&#8217;re buying it with crypto or a foreign currency, you might pay an extra 1-5%.</li>



<li><strong>Third-Party Markup</strong> â€“ If youâ€™re buying from a reseller, they may charge an additional percentage.</li>
</ol>



<p>If youâ€™re buying from an official provider like Vanilla Visa or a bank, you might just pay the face value ($1,000) plus a small fee. If you&#8217;re getting it from a crypto exchange or P2P seller, expect to pay more, sometimes up to <strong>5-15% extra</strong>.</p>



<p>Considering the fees mentioned above, when utilizing CoinCannon, you will ONLY pay a 1% to 5% exchange fee and there will be <strong>no extra charge at all</strong>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-do-i-need-to-purchase-a-prepaid-card">What do I Need to Purchase a Prepaid Card?</h2>



<p>When purchasing a credit card for online shopping, you will have to sign up on the retailer&#8217;s website and disclose lots and lots of your personal information. mind you, the process can take days! As mentioned before, there are many countries in which online credit cards or even prepaid cards do not provide services. Other than that, paying for the credit card does also require a specific currency. In that regard, you might have to exchange what you already have beforehand and pay for yet another exchange fee.</p>



<p>By using CoinCannon, you will not share any personal information and basically do not need anything to make the purchase. CoinCannon supports 100+ currencies for payment and will instantly make your purchase. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-24-7-online-support">24/7 Online Support</h2>



<p>In order to make sure everything goes as planned, CoinCannon provides online support available all day, everyday. So get started now and Enjoy Online Payments like never before!</p>
