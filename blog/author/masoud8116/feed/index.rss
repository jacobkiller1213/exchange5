<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Choose a Trusted Exchange Service</strong>: Select a reputable exchange platform with a proven track record of reliability and security. Research customer reviews and ratings to gauge the trustworthiness of the service provider before initiating the exchange.</li>



<li><strong>Verify SSL Encryption</strong>: Ensure that the exchange website uses SSL encryption to secure your data during the transaction. Look for &#8220;https://&#8221; at the beginning of the website URL and a padlock icon in the browser address bar to confirm the encryption.</li>



<li><strong>Check for Secure Payment Gateways</strong>: Verify that the exchange service uses secure payment gateways to process transactions. Payment gateways such as PayPal often have robust security measures in place to protect users&#8217; financial information.</li>



<li><strong>Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</strong>: If the exchange platform offers two-factor authentication, enable it for an extra layer of security. 2FA adds an additional verification step, typically involving a code sent to your mobile device, which helps prevent unauthorized access to your account.</li>



<li><strong>Verify Transaction Details</strong>: Before confirming the exchange, carefully review the transaction details, including the exchange rate, fees, and recipient account information. Ensure that all information is accurate to avoid errors or potential fraud.</li>



<li><strong>Use Strong Passwords</strong>: Create strong, unique passwords for both your WebMoney and PayPal accounts to prevent unauthorized access. Avoid using easily guessable passwords and consider using a password manager to securely store and manage your passwords.</li>



<li><strong>Beware of Phishing Attempts</strong>: Be cautious of phishing attempts that mimic legitimate exchange websites or emails. Always access the exchange platform directly through a secure link and avoid clicking on suspicious links or providing sensitive information in unsolicited emails.</li>



<li><strong>Monitor Account Activity</strong>: Regularly monitor your WebMoney and PayPal accounts for any unauthorized or suspicious activity. Report any unusual transactions or signs of unauthorized access to the respective customer support teams immediately.</li>



<li><strong>Keep Software Updated</strong>: Ensure that your devices and software, including web browsers and security software, are up-to-date with the latest security patches and updates. Regular updates help protect against known vulnerabilities and security threats.</li>
</ol>



<p>By following these tips, you can enhance the security of your exchange from WebMoney to PayPal and minimize the risk of unauthorized access, fraud, or other security breaches.</p>

<p>PayPal&#8217;s launch of PayPal USD, a U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin, is indeed a significant milestone for the company and the broader digital payments industry. This move demonstrates PayPal&#8217;s commitment to staying at the forefront of innovation and meeting the evolving needs of its customers.</p>



<div class="wp-block-buttons is-layout-flex wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex">
<div class="wp-block-button"><a class="wp-block-button__link has-text-align-center wp-element-button" href="/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Exchange PYUSD Now!</a></div>
</div>



<p>By offering a stablecoin payment option, PayPal is providing its users with increased convenience, efficiency, and security in their transactions. Stablecoins, backed by traditional currencies like the U.S. dollar, offer stability and eliminate the volatility often associated with cryptocurrencies. This feature makes stablecoins a reliable and attractive option for both individuals and businesses.</p>



<p>Furthermore, PayPal&#8217;s entry into the stablecoin market contributes to the mainstream adoption of digital currencies. PayPal&#8217;s endorsement of stablecoins brings further legitimacy and trust to the cryptocurrency ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>CoinCannon is constantly committed to delivering the utmost quality to customers.</p>



<p> which is why we promptly incorporated PayPal&nbsp; Stablecoin into our website shortly after its initial release. You can exchange&nbsp; PayPal&nbsp; Stablecoin easily on CoinCannon.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-pyusd">What is PYUSD?</h2>



<p>The launch of PayPal USD aligns with the growing demand for digital payments and the increasing popularity of cryptocurrencies. By integrating stablecoins into its platform, PayPal is catering to the needs and preferences of its user base, providing them with more choices and flexibility in managing their finances.<gwmw style="display:none;"></gwmw></p>



<p>Overall, PayPal&#8217;s introduction of PayPal USD is a commendable step towards embracing the future of finance and empowering individuals and businesses with secure and efficient digital payment options.<gwmw style="display:none;"></gwmw></p>



<p>PayPal&#8217;s decision to fully back PayPal USD with U.S. dollar deposits, short-term Treasurys, and cash equivalents is a commendable approach that enhances the stability and reliability of the stablecoin. </p>



<p>This commitment to ensuring a 1-to-1 ratio between the stablecoin and the U.S. dollar.</p>



<p> demonstrates PayPal&#8217;s dedication to maintaining the trust and confidence of its users.</p>



<p>Partnering with Paxos Trust Company, a reputable fintech company specializing in blockchain, further strengthens the credibility and security of PayPal USD. This collaboration brings together the expertise of both companies, ensuring the seamless issuance and management of the stablecoin.<gwmw style="display:none;"></gwmw></p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><a href="/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>You can exchange PayPal USD on CoinCannon Now!</strong><gwmw style="display:none;"></gwmw></a></p></blockquote></figure>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-paypal-stablecoin-is-now-available">PayPal Stablecoin is Now Available&nbsp;</h1>



<p>PayPal&#8217;s president and CEO, acknowledges the need for a stable instrument that is digitally native and easily connected to fiat.</p>



<p> By introducing PayPal USD, PayPal is meeting this need and empowering individuals and businesses with a reliable and efficient means of conducting digital transactions.<gwmw style="display:none;"></gwmw><gwmw style="display:none;"></gwmw><gwmw style="display:none;"></gwmw></p>



<p>While it is important to be aware of the risks associated with stablecoins and cryptocurrencies in general, PayPal USD offers consumers increased flexibility and payment options. The decentralized nature of stablecoins provides users with greater control over their finances, and the ability to transfer and exchange the stablecoin easily adds to its appeal.<gwmw style="display:none;"></gwmw></p>



<p>It is crucial for potential investors to carefully consider their risk tolerance and conduct thorough research before investing in any financial asset, including stablecoins. However, PayPal&#8217;s commitment to stability, its partnership with a reputable company, and the benefits of increased flexibility and decentralization make PayPal USD an intriguing option for those looking to explore the world of digital currencies.</p>



<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been cracking down on crypto companies, including Paxos, the partner of PayPal in issuing the stablecoin. The SEC threatened to sue Paxos in February, claiming that their Binance USD coin was not a registered security. This crackdown is part of the SEC&#8217;s efforts to enforce federal investment laws and address potential risks posed by crypto assets to the financial system. The collapse of Luna and its stablecoin, TerraUSD, last year further accelerated the SEC&#8217;s enforcement actions.</p>



<p>Although the SEC has targeted several crypto firms in recent years, it has yet to establish a clear framework for defining and regulating stablecoins. In the case of Paxos, the SEC argued that Binance USD qualifies as a security due to its profit-earning potential as an investment contract. This differs from the agency&#8217;s classification of Terra as an algorithmic stablecoin without investment backing.</p>



<p>Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that are pegged to the value of another financial instrument, often a currency or commodity, and can be used for payments. The most prominent U.S. dollar-backed stablecoins include TetherUSD, USD Coin, and Binance USD.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-are-potential-use-cases-and-benefits-of-pyusd">What are potential use cases and benefits of PYUSD <gwmw style="display:none;"></gwmw></h2>



<p>The potential uses and benefits of a truly decentralized U.S. dollar stablecoin are significant for the average consumer. It would provide a borderless and potentially uncensorable version of the world&#8217;s reserve currency, enabling people in countries excluded from traditional U.S. payment rails to transact with ease.&nbsp;<gwmw style="display:none;"></gwmw></p>



<p>However, the introduction of PYUSD by PayPal through Venmo seems to limit its utility to banked Americans who already have access to digital representations of the U.S. dollar through PayPal&#8217;s existing products. Although PYUSD may be sent outside of PayPal&#8217;s ecosystem via the Ethereum network, it is unlikely that PayPal would allow this, as the stablecoin is not truly decentralized.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-benefits-of-pyusd">Benefits of PYUSD</h3>



<p>Nevertheless, if individuals who are banned from using Venmo or PayPal in the United States find a way to withdraw their funds via PYUSD on the Ethereum network, it could potentially benefit both PayPal and the consumers with frozen funds. However, this scenario is speculative, and the actual use cases and benefits of PYUSD are more likely to be exploited and utilized by financial institutions rather than directly impacting the average consumer.</p>



<p>Once the transaction gets confirmed on the blockchain network, Your cryptocurrency to PayPal stablecoin&nbsp; exchange will be completed easily and automatically without any waiting period by fulfilling the easy steps that we explained.<gwmw style="display:none;"></gwmw></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Justice Department is investigating Binance Holdings, the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency exchange. Primarily, this is to determine whether it violated economic sanctions imposed on Russia. According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-05/binance-faces-us-probe-of-possible-russian-sanctions-violations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg</a>, the probe is examining whether the exchange or its employees breached the sanctions put in place due to Moscow&#8217;s military actions in Ukraine. Despite the allegations, Binance insists that it follows all US and international sanctions. On the other hand, the Russian authorities have made official statements on how they have planned to curb sanctions using cryptocurrencies.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Learn <a href="https://hi.exchange/blog/exchange-cryptocurrency-to-paypal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How to Exchange Cryptocurrency to PayPal</a></p></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-binance-exchange-and-compliance-with-sanctions"><strong>Binance Exchange and Compliance with Sanctions</strong></h2>



<p>Binance claims that it has implemented an initiative to revamp its corporate governance structure and transform its global operations. The exchange also states that it has a know-your-customer (KYC) process that rivals that of traditional banking systems. Its KYC process includes a mandatory disclosure of residence and personal identification checks. The company takes a zero-tolerance approach to double registrations, anonymous identities, and obscure sources of funds.</p>



<p>“In 2021, Binance launched an initiative to completely overhaul its corporate governance structure, including bringing in a world-class bench of seasoned executives to fundamentally change how Binance operates globally.”</p>



<p>Back in 2021, Binance pledged to abide by EU’s ruling on <a href="https://hi.exchange/blog/binance-russian-sanctions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Russian sanctions</a>. Despite that, the Justice Department will not make baseless accusations on such critical matters. For the most part, it would be interesting to see what evidence the DOJ holds on Binance exchange.</p>



<p>Based on the report, the investigation is looking into whether the exchange or some of its employees helped Russia with supplying money for their operations in Ukraine. This is according to five anonymous sources.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Binance&#8217;s Struggles with Regulators</strong></h2>



<p>Binance has faced numerous allegations from US regulators and authorities in recent years. Although many of the claims were unsubstantiated, the exchange has been under scrutiny. Earlier this year, anti-crypto Senator Elizabeth Warren and other officials wrote an open letter to Binance asking for various information from the firm. They alleged that the exchange was facilitating illicit activity by intentionally concealing its activities.</p>



<p>Binance exchange responded to the claims made by the senators, stating that most of the information was taken from inaccurate media reports. The exchange denies allegations of violating sanctions against Russia and insists that it adheres to all US and international sanctions. Binance has taken steps to address compliance concerns by revamping its corporate governance structure and enhancing its KYC process.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Walking a Thin Line</strong>&#8230;</h2>



<p>Being the world’s largest crypto exchange certainly has its own baggage. Back in 2021, Changpeng Zhao, the CEO of Binance exchange revealed one of the largest Ponzi schemes in the history of crypto. Essentially, Changpeng Zhao went to war with Sam Bankman-Fried and dumped all their <a href="https://hi.exchange/blog/binance-liquidates-ftx-token/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FTX token</a> holdings. Within a matter of days, the <a href="https://hi.exchange/blog/ftx-collapse/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FTX collapsed</a> and a vast majority of investors lost their assets overnight. Soon after the collapse, countless sources revealed how SBF had strong ties with the US democratic party.</p>



<p>Subsequently, Binance exchange has found itself in the middle of a political war. With that, it is only natural for the regulators to probe into their operations and look for something. Now, while Changpeng Zhao revealed a true scam operation, it doesn’t mean that Binance is without fault. Considering the scale of their operations, one can safely assume that they have certainly slipped more than a few times.</p>



<p>And in case of Russian sanctions and all the crimes against humanity charges on Russian authorities, even a small proof that they helped Russia with their sanctions can have devastating repercussions for Binance exchange. But that’s not all.</p>



<p>In case the investigation manages to convict Binance, we could expect even more restrictive <a href="https://hi.exchange/blog/crypto-regulations-sec-cftc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">crypto regulations</a>. &nbsp;While Changpeng Zhao shrugs off the serious charges against them as simply “FUD”, Binance exchange is facing life or death situation as the lawsuits against them keep stacking up.</p>

<p>Looking for the best platform to exchange Dogecoin to Tether? CoinCannon is all you need. For the past two years, DOGE has been a hot topic of conversation. Despite all the huge growth in short periods of time, Dogecoin remains as a highly volatile crypto asset. In that regard, most investors tend to convert DOGE to Tether USDT in case they’re looking to hold assets for a while. However, it’s not easy to find an anonymous exchange platform that offers low exchange fees. In this article, we will go over everything you need to know on how to exchange Dogecoin to Tether USDT.</p>



<p>So, get started! Head over to <a href="http://www.hi.exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jolixo</a>, select Dogecoin and Tether on the box and you’re good to go.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Learn <a href="https://hi.exchange/blog/exchange-cryptocurrency-to-paypal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How to Exchange Cryptocurrency to PayPal</a></p></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What Do I Need to Exchange Dogecoin to Tether?</strong></h2>



<p>For this exchange, you will need a crypto wallet to receive USDT. Most likely, your Dogecoin wallet supports USDT, so you can also receive funds in the same wallet. Make sure that you are using a reliable crypto wallet to hold your assets. On the other hand, for CoinCannon platform, all you need is an email address. CoinCannon does not require KYC (know your customer) or sign up. However, there are benefits and rewards for those who <a href="https://hi.exchange/blog/reasosn-sign-up-jolixo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sign up on CoinCannon</a>. How do you like winning $100 gifts ever single month?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is Dogecoin (DOGE)?</strong></h2>



<p>Dogecoin started off as somewhat of a joke, but it developed a following after it was created. By the end of 2017, Dogecoin was a part of the cryptocurrency bubble that sent up the prices of several coins dramatically. Dogecoin lost much of its value after the bubble burst in 2018, but it still has a core of supporters who trade it and use it to tip Twitter and Reddit content.</p>



<p>Dogecoin (DOGE) is an open-source, peer-to-peer cryptocurrency. It is called an altcoin and as mentioned, many believe it is an almost sarcastic meme coin. Although it was seemingly developed as a joke, the blockchain of Dogecoin still has value. It derives its underlying technology from Litecoin. The low price and infinite supply of Dogecoin are noteworthy features of this cryptocurrency, which uses a scrypt algorithm.</p>



<p>You can read more about <a href="https://hi.exchange/blog/what-is-dogecoin-how-it-work/">What is Dogecoin</a> at our article fully dedicated to this Cryptocurrency in case you need to do your research about this coin.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why Exchange Dogecoin to Tether?</strong></h2>



<p>At this point, it’s good to briefly introduce Tether. Tether is a cryptocurrency based on blockchain whose crypto coins in use are backed by an equivalent amount of traditional fiat currencies, such as the Dollar, Euro, or Japanese Yen that is retained in a specific bank account. The Tether tokens, the Tether network’s native tokens, trade under the USDT symbol.</p>



<p>In contrast to the wide swings observed in the prices of other popular cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, Tether belongs to a new race of cryptocurrencies called stablecoins that aims to keep cryptocurrency valuations stable. Instead of being used as a means of speculative investment, this would allow Tether to be used as a medium of exchange and a mode of storage of value.</p>



<p>Tether was specifically developed to create the necessary CoinCannon between fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies, providing users with stability, transparency, and minimum transaction fees. It is pegged against the US dollar and, in terms of value, maintains a 1-to-1 ratio with USD. There is, however, no guarantee provided by Tether Ltd. for any right to redeem or exchange real money for Tethers, i.e. Tethers cannot be exchanged for U.S. Dollars.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>CoinCannon Platform</strong></h2>



<p>Say goodbye to the hassle of searching for the perfect online exchange. CoinCannon is here to offer you everything you need and more. With a combination of anonymity, unbeatable exchange rates, and reliability, it’s a platform like no other.</p>



<p>At CoinCannon, your privacy is our top priority. We understand the importance of keeping personal information safe, and that’s why we don’t require it from our customers. With no KYC or sign-up required, you can trade confidently and securely.</p>

<li>Enter the Homepage on CoinCannon. Select Dogecoin (DOGE) on the left field and Tether USDT on the right one. Enter the exchange amount and wait for the rates to apply.</li>



<li>Click on Exchange and you will be forwarded to the next step where you will need to enter your USDT wallet address, email, and phone number (optional).</li>



<li>Click on “Exchange” one more time as you go to the next page to review your order.</li>

<p>Looking to exchange AdvCash to Bitcoin? CoinCannon offers everything you need! Digital currencies have been a quintessential asset for online payments. On top of that, cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) are gaining momentum as popular payment methods. In that regard, users will find themselves in the need to exchange their assets into one another. And by doing so, the exchange fees can quickly put a dent in their pockets. Fortunately, you can easily exchange AdvCash to Bitcoin with the lowest fees, full anonymity and 24/7 online support. Want to know how?</p>



<p>Head over to <a href="http://www.hi.exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jolixo</a>, select AdvCash and Bitcoin in the exchange box and you’re good to go!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Learn <a href="https://hi.exchange/blog/exchange-cryptocurrency-to-paypal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How to Exchange Cryptocurrency to PayPal</a></p></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What Do I Need to Exchange AdvCash to Bitcoin?</strong></h2>



<p>For this exchange, you will need a verified and active Advanced Cash (AdvCash) account. Make sure that the transaction amount does not exceed your withdrawal limit. To receive Bitcoin (BTC), you will need a reliable and secure crypto wallet. Primarily, we suggest you use Trust Wallet. As for CoinCannon, all you need is an email address. CoinCannon provides a hassle-free KYC process and no sign up to speed up your work flow. Despite that, there are benefits for those who sign up on CoinCannon. For example, you can take advantage of <a href="https://hi.exchange/jolixo-affiliate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CoinCannon affiliate</a> program and earn money online.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is Advanced Cash (AdvCash)?</strong></h2>



<p>Before we go on to talk about how to convert AdvCash to Bitcoin, let’s take a quick look at what this digital currency is. AdvCash is a currency used for online payments. It is based in Belize which provides immunity from national laws of other countries for it. As an offshore currency, it is also encrypted much like cryptocurrencies and benefits from better anonymity and security. The Advance Cash company provides an account for users that allows for a variety of currencies to operate through it. In many ways, it is a lot like Payeer.</p>



<p>And much like Payeer, AdvCash supports transfers in both fiat and cryptocurrency form. With a virtual wallet, users can transfer funds and make payments with very low commission. What makes it interesting, is that Advance Cash is also compatible with other payment systems such as WebMoney or Perfect Money. With free international transfers, users get to enjoy a wide variety of currencies all in a virtual wallet. Furthermore, there are both physical and virtual bank cards available for quick and cheap international Visa/Mastercard payments.</p>



<p>The company was founded in 2014 as a competitor for PayPal and much like its peers, it has gained notable success in the past few years. As the need for virtual banking grows, online payment processing companies continue to narrow the gap with PayPal. Although, such companies are not as popular as PayPal, they offer a lot more freedom.</p>



<p>Keep in mind that you can also <a href="https://blog.hi.exchange/exchange-advcash-to-payeer-usd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Exchange AdvCash to PayPal</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why Exchange AdvCash to Bitcoin?</strong></h2>



<p>Bitcoin is a digital currency that was developed following the housing market crash in January 2009. This cryptocurrency follows the ideas started out by the pseudonymous and mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto in a whitepaper. The identity of the individual or individuals that developed the software is still a mystery. Unlike government-issued currencies, Bitcoin is operated by a decentralized authority and offers the promise of lower transaction fees than traditional online payment mechanisms.</p>



<p>There are no physical Bitcoins and the coins you see are novelty coins that do not have any real value without the code inscribed on them. Bitcoin is only balances retained on a public ledger that everyone has transparent access to, and is verified by a massive amount of computing power along with all Bitcoin transactions. Bitcoins are not issued or supported as a commodity by any banks or governments, nor are individual bitcoins valuable. Although it is not legal tender, the popularity of Bitcoin charts is high, and hundreds of other virtual currencies collectively referred to as Altcoins have been launched following this cryptocurrency.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>CoinCannon Platform</strong></h2>

<p>The role of cryptocurrency in the failures of banks Silvergate, Silicon Valley, and Signature has been highlighted in a recent <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IN/IN12148" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a> by the Congressional Research Service (CRS). The report examines the impact of crypto on the US banking crisis and reveals that the banks&#8217; exposure to crypto was minimal, but the perception of risk &#8220;may have driven non-crypto firms/individuals to make significant withdrawals.&#8221; Interestingly, the statement sheds light on a critical issue regarding crypto assets. Despite all the bullish predictions, the failure of crypto-friendly banks outlines the severe lack of trust in crypto still dominant among retail investors.</p>



<p>Learn <a href="https://hi.exchange/blog/exchange-cryptocurrency-to-paypal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How to Exchange Cryptocurrency to PayPal</a></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Limited Exposure to Crypto</strong></h2>



<p>According to analyst Paul Tierno from CRS, the banks&#8217; exposure to crypto &#8220;was somewhat limited.&#8221; Tierno noted that &#8220;volatility in crypto markets may expose banks to liquidity risks that could ultimately lead to fatal losses.&#8221; However, it was the dwindling deposits from crypto firms that led banks to sell securities at a loss, exacerbating liquidity issues and solvency.</p>



<p>In November 2021, the crypto market reached an all-time high of around $3 trillion. However, by December 2022, the market lost more than two-thirds of its market capitalization. The report highlighted that the fall in digital asset prices led to centralized crypto platforms and stablecoin issuers experiencing redemptions, causing them to draw down deposits held at these banks.</p>



<p>To meet the withdrawal demand, banks sold securities for losses, affecting their liquidity and, in some cases, solvency. For instance, Silvergate&#8217;s deposits fell by over half, while Signature&#8217;s deposits dropped by 15% in Q4 2022. The CRS report emphasized that the losses were not realized on crypto-related assets but were caused by crypto deposit withdrawals.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="703" src="https://hi.exchange/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/US-Banking-Crisis.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-6431" srcset="https://hi.exchange/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/US-Banking-Crisis.jpg 1024w, https://hi.exchange/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/US-Banking-Crisis-300x206.jpg 300w, https://hi.exchange/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/US-Banking-Crisis-768x527.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-crypto-s-impact-on-us-banking-crisis"><strong>Crypto’s Impact on US Banking Crisis</strong></h2>



<p>The CRS report reminds us that the crypto market chaos affected US bank stocks. SVB, Silvergate, and Signature were pushed over the edge by fear, uncertainty, and doubt. The report concluded that &#8220;banks must be prepared for the potential of rapid withdrawal of deposits. This can exacerbate liquidity issues and, ultimately, threaten solvency.&#8221;</p>



<p>In conclusion, the CRS report serves as a reminder that the crypto market&#8217;s volatility can impact US banks. Although the banks&#8217; exposure to crypto was limited, the perception of risk was enough to drive non-crypto firms/individuals to make significant withdrawals, leading to the banks selling securities at a loss. This affected their liquidity and, in some cases, their solvency. </p>



<p>However, it’s also important to analyze the fear and the lack of trust in crypto. Perhaps, the volatility is the key factor here. Yet, the <a href="https://hi.exchange/blog/ftx-collapse/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FTX collapse</a>, may have been a big wake up call for investors. Portraying how easy it is to run a multi-billion dollar scam, Sam Bankman-Fried may have permanently stained the face of crypto. considering this congressional report, we can see how limited exposure to crypto can have negative effects on their business. With all that in mind, we can see how banks may be hesitant to integrate crypto asset into their systems.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Learn <a href="https://hi.exchange/blog/exchange-cryptocurrency-to-paypal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How to Exchange Cryptocurrency to PayPal</a></p></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-do-i-need-to-exchange-litecoin-to-tether"><strong>What Do I Need to Exchange Litecoin to Tether?</strong></h2>



<p>For this exchange, you will need a crypto wallet to receive USDT. Most likely, your Litecoin wallet supports USDT, so you can also receive funds in the same wallet. Make sure that you are using a reliable crypto wallet to hold your assets. On the other hand, for CoinCannon platform, all you need is an email address.

How do you like winning $100 gifts ever single month?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is Litecoin (LTC)?</strong></h2>



<p>Litecoin was one of the earliest Bitcoin spinoffs back in 2011. Generally speaking, Litecoin bears resemblance to Bitcoin in many ways. It is essentially a global payment network that is autonomous and open-source. The decentralized network does not allow a central authority to take control over the payments. LTC is the native currency of this network which is the medium for all transactions within the network. Litecoin utilizes a proof of work (POW) blockchain network meaning that there are active miners working for it.</p>



<p>So far, it looks to be Another Bitcoin impersonator. However, the LTC network uses a different cryptographic algorithm called scrypt. Furthermore, it provides much faster block generation speeds and subsequently much better scalability.</p>



<p>As of April 2023, LTC is 12<sup>th</sup> cryptocurrency in the ranks with a market cap of over $6.5 billion. To learn everything about the network and its cryptocurrency continue reading “<a href="https://hi.exchange/blog/what-is-litecoin/">What is Litecoin?”</a></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why Exchange Litecoin to Tether?</strong></h2>



<p>At this point, it’s good to briefly introduce Tether. Tether is a cryptocurrency based on blockchain whose crypto coins in use are backed by an equivalent amount of traditional fiat currencies, such as the Dollar, Euro, or Japanese Yen that is retained in a specific bank account. The Tether tokens, the Tether network’s native tokens, trade under the USDT symbol.</p>



<p>In contrast to the wide swings observed in the prices of other popular cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, Tether belongs to a new race of cryptocurrencies called stablecoins that aims to keep cryptocurrency valuations stable. Instead of being used as a means of speculative investment, this would allow Tether to be used as a medium of exchange and a mode of storage of value.</p>



<p>Tether was specifically developed to create the necessary CoinCannon between fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies, providing users with stability, transparency, and minimum transaction fees. It is pegged against the US dollar and, in terms of value, maintains a 1-to-1 ratio with USD. There is, however, no guarantee provided by Tether Ltd. for any right to redeem or exchange real money for Tethers, i.e. Tethers cannot be exchanged for U.S. Dollars.</p>

<p>it is easy, it is affordable and it is anonymous a lot like the CoinCannon Platform! The E-Voucher is the solution to some of our biggest payment problems. The electronic voucher is a method of payment that is redeemable instantly. The user pays a specific amount of funds and creates a voucher. Then, the information for the voucher can easily be delivered to the receiver and they will have the choice to redeem the payment anytime they want. Much like a gift card or a bank check, the voucher will hold the value permanently since the payment has already been made.</p>



<p>Although there are numerous applications for this, here are some of the common utilities:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>You can create a voucher to make payments when you don’t have access to your Perfect Money account.</li>



<li>Perfect Money E-Voucher is a good method of payment when you don’t carry cash or traveling abroad.</li>



<li>As a service provider, users can receive vouchers if they don’t wish to reveal their account address.</li>



<li>Send your loved ones a voucher instead of a gift card</li>
</ul>



<p>Perfect Money E-Voucher does not cost users a lot of money to make! You can simply go to CoinCannon and create your voucher immediately with the lowest fees. On top of that, unlike a majority of exchanges, CoinCannon does not require KYC (know your customer) or even a sign up process. It is truly fast and truly anonymous.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-perfect-money"><strong>What is Perfect Money?</strong></h2>



<p>Perfect Money is an e-currency for making payments on the internet. It is widely accepted as payment option by countless platforms. With Perfect Money, you can do a lot! Be it transferring funds to others or pay for goods and services. Or how about buying cryptocurrencies or even buying fiat currencies. It is a seriously popular payment method for online users. An additional capability is to loan and receipt issuance throughout the system.</p>



<p>The biggest downside of Perfect Money, however, is that you cannot cash Perfect money to your bank account on its website directly. For that, you will need a platform like CoinCannon to exchange your Perfect Money to PayPal and other e-currencies.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-jolixo-does-it-better"><strong>CoinCannon Does It Better!</strong></h2>



<p>Essentially, you need three primary qualities in an ideal exchange platform. Anonymity, good rates and reliability. The CoinCannon team consists of traders and professionals who have felt the need for an ideal exchange and pursued their vision.</p>



<p>First and foremost, all users need to protect their personal information especially when it comes down to financial transactions. Unfortunately, a vast majority of exchange apps and platforms make massive profits off of selling user data. Best case scenario, they are legally bound to disclose user information with national authorities for any reason. In that regard, the best method to protect your privacy is to not disclose them with anyone at all. CoinCannon does not require customers to go through KYC (know your customer) or even a mandatory sign up. In that regard, it is simply as safe as one can get making an exchange.</p>



<p>On the other hand, privacy is not a reason to pay more on your exchange. With that in mind, the platform offers some of the most competitive exchange rates you can find anywhere. Don’t take our word for it. You can simply pay a visit to ranking websites such as BestChange or OkChanger and see compare our rates with others.</p>



<p>Last but not least, not everything goes as planned in the digital world. Subsequently, the platform provides true online 24/7 customer support for the users.</p>
