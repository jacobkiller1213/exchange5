<p>Here’s the easiest way to exchange BNB to USDT instantly with full anonymity! Binance Coin (BNB) is one of the top crypto assets by market cap. For the most part, this popularity stem’s from Binance’s massive scale as an exchange platform. Now, while users can easily exchange BNB to USDT on Binance platform, they will have to compromise on their privacy to do the job. Primarily, Binance requires a much stricter KYC process to authenticate users. On top of that, they will have to comply with multiple governments and share user data with the authorities. Fortunately, CoinCannon cuts down all complications by offering a truly hassle-free KYC process. Furthermore, privacy will not come as a luxury sine CoinCannon offer the lowest exchange fees. With all that, here is a full guide on how to exchange Binance Coin to Tether USDT in only a matter of minutes.</p>



<p>So, head over to <a href="http://www.hi.exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jolixo</a>, choose Binance Coin (BNB) on the left field and Tether (USDT) on the right one and start your exchange.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Learn <a href="https://hi.exchange/blog/exchange-cryptocurrency-to-paypal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How to Exchange Cryptocurrency to PayPal</a></p></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What Do I Need to Exchange BNB to USDT?</strong></h2>



<p>For this exchange, you will need a crypto wallet to receive USDT. Most likely, your Cardano wallet supports USDT, so you can also receive funds in the same wallet. Make sure that you are using a reliable crypto wallet to hold your assets. On the other hand, for CoinCannon platform, all you need is an email address. CoinCannon does not require KYC (know your customer) or sign up. However, there are benefits and rewards for those who <a href="https://hi.exchange/blog/reasosn-sign-up-jolixo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sign up on CoinCannon</a>. How do you like winning $100 gifts ever single month?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is Binance Coin (BNB)?</strong></h2>



<p>Before we go over how to exchange BNB to USDT, let’s go over a brief introduction on Binance Coin. Initially found in China, Binance began as an online cryptocurrency exchange with a strong emphasis on altcoin trading. It didn’t take long for Binance to be crowned as the number one exchange in the world. Amongst the numerous motivating factors and reasons for this profound success, the primary one was high liquidity, low transaction fees and additional discounts for users who made payments by its native coin, BNB. The massive platform has a staggering capacity to process approximately 1.4 million orders per second, offering trading for more than 500 cryptocurrencies and virtual tokens.</p>



<p>As for trading, Binance offers seven trade orders of Limit order, Market order, stop limit order, stop market order, Trailing stop order, Post only order and Limit TP/SL order. Despite the varying transaction fees for withdrawal based on the currency and its amount, there is no transaction fee for deposits.</p>



<p>Initially introduced as an ERC20 Ethereum based cryptocurrency in 2017, BNB has now moved on to Binance’s own blockchain named Binance chain. As the native coin for Binance exchange, BNB was primarily a utility token to motivate users for transaction fee discounts. However, the applications for Binance coin have now expanded dramatically since you can now use Binance Coin for financial services, entertainment, online services and many more.</p>



<p>With all this development happening in a short time period, the 26,500% overall price increase (correct as of January 2022) since being introduced in 2017 is well justified. As of June 4th 2021 BNB has a market cap of $53.7 billion dollars and is only ranked behind Bitcoin and Ethereum.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why Exchange BNB to USDT?</strong></h2>



<p>At this point, it’s good to briefly introduce Tether. Tether is a cryptocurrency based on blockchain whose crypto coins in use are backed by an equivalent amount of traditional fiat currencies, such as the Dollar, Euro, or Japanese Yen that is retained in a specific bank account. The Tether tokens, the Tether network’s native tokens, trade under the USDT symbol.</p>



<p>In contrast to the wide swings observed in the prices of other popular cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, Tether belongs to a new race of cryptocurrencies called stablecoins that aims to keep cryptocurrency valuations stable. Instead of being used as a means of speculative investment, this would allow Tether to be used as a medium of exchange and a mode of storage of value.</p>



<p>Tether was specifically developed to create the necessary CoinCannon between fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies, providing users with stability, transparency, and minimum transaction fees. It is pegged against the US dollar and, in terms of value, maintains a 1-to-1 ratio with USD. There is, however, no guarantee provided by Tether Ltd. for any right to redeem or exchange real money for Tethers, i.e. Tethers cannot be exchanged for U.S. Dollars.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>CoinCannon Platform</strong></h2>

<p>Looking to exchange AdvCash to Binance Coin? <a href="http://www.hi.exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jolixo</a> is the best platform for the job. AdvCash has arguably been gaining lots of traction as a payment method. This doesn’t come as a surprise since it offers excellent diversity and very low fees. However, it is almost crucial to use a mediator in order to buy and sell AdvCash. Finding a third party exchanger is always a big hassle because it is not easy to trust a new platform. Fortunately, CoinCannon provides everything you need including no added fees, no KYC and of course competitive exchange rates. In this article, we will go over everything you need to exchange AdvCash to Binance Coin.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What Do I Need to Exchange AdvCash to Binance Coin?</strong></h2>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is AdvCash?</strong></h2>



<p>AdvCash is a currency used for online payments. It is based in Belize which provides immunity from national laws of other countries for it. As an offshore currency, it is also encrypted much like cryptocurrencies and benefits from better anonymity and security. The Advance Cash company provides an account for users that allows for a variety of currencies to operate through it. In many ways, it is a lot like Payeer.</p>



<p>And much like Payeer, AdvCash supports transfers in both fiat and cryptocurrency form. With a virtual wallet, users can transfer funds and make payments with very low commission. What makes it interesting, is that Advance Cash is also compatible with other payment systems such as WebMoney or Perfect Money. With free international transfers, users get to enjoy a wide variety of currencies all in a virtual wallet. Furthermore, there are both physical and virtual bank cards available for quick and cheap international Visa/Mastercard payments.</p>



<p>The company was founded in 2014 as a competitor for PayPal and much like its peers, it has gained notable success in the past few years. As the need for virtual banking grows, online payment processing companies continue to narrow the gap with PayPal. Although, such companies are not as popular as PayPal, they offer a lot more freedom.</p>

<p>BNB price faced strong resistance at $340 and had to back down. By losing the $300 and $275, Binance Coin fell down to $260 on September 6 but found support. With that, it had a chance to recover and managed to surpass $275 and $285 to reach $300. At that point, it hit a downtrend and had to once again back down to $275. Currently, BNB price is at $280.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><mark style="background-color:#ffffff" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">Exchange Binance Coin (BNB) to PayPal instantly on <a href="http://www.hi.exchange" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jolixo</a></mark></p></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>BNB Price Action Analysis</strong></h2>



<p>Taking a look at the 4-hour chart, we see BNB hitting a dead end at $340 and having to back down with a downward channel. Following that, the price continued ranging between the top and bottom and hit the bottom at $260. Subsequently, BNB managed to bounce back and recover. Binance coin surpassed $275 and $285 and peaked at $300 on September 12. Once again, the price turned back down after touching the ceiling and fell down to $275.</p>



<p>At the moment, the $275 is the first support level for BNB. In case of successful support, we expect Binance coin to continue upwards. For the bullish scenario, the $285 and then 295 on the SMA100 are the first resistance levels for the price. In case BNB breaks through the top of the channel, it could reach $300 and $310.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if BNB price fails to surpass $285 and loses the $275, further correction will follow. In which case, the $270 and $260 are the next support levels. Further decline can bring BNB as low as $250 and $240.</p>

<p>BNB price failed to surpass $340 on August 11 and had to back down. Subsequently, it lost the $315, $305 and $300 levels and fell down to $280 on August 20. At that point, the price found support on the uptrend and managed to bounce back. With that, Binance coin had a chance for recovery and climbed all the way up to $305 but faced strong resistance. Once again, BNB price had a correction and is currently trading at $295.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><mark style="background-color:#ffffff" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">Exchange Binance Coin (BNB) to PayPal instantly on <a href="http://www.hi.exchange" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jolixo</a></mark></p></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>BNB Price Action Analysis</strong></h2>



<p>Taking a look at the 4-hour chart, we see BNB riding on an uptrend in the long-term. Characteristically, the price reached a top of $340 on August 11 but failed to surpass this level and faced a correction. At that point, BNB fell down to $275 and had support at the uptrend. Therefore, it set to recover but had to halt by reaching the 50% Fibonacci retracement level. Currently, BNB is trading at $295.</p>



<p>For the moment, the $295 on the SMA100 is the key support level for Binance coin. In case of providing sufficient support, we can expect further growth in short-term. For the bullish scenario, the $305 will be the first resistance level. After that, the $320 and $340 will be next in line. In case of a successful break through from $340, we can expect $260 and $380 to follow.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if BNB price fails to surpass $305 and subsequently loses the $295, further decline will follow. In which case, the long-term uptrend is expected to support BNB at $275. Losing this level would bring Binance coin as low as $240.</p>

<p>BNB price had support at $190 on June 19<sup>th</sup> and bounced back with an upwards channel. With that, the price continued on ranging between the top and bottom. On July 26, BNB found support at the bottom of the channel at $240. Subsequently, Binance Coin surpassed $255 resistance level and the SMA100. After that, it managed to break through $275 and reached $300 yesterday. At that point, BNB price hit the top of the channel at and fell down to $275. As expected, the bottom provided solid support and BNB set to recover. Binance Coin climbed all the way up to $320 on August 5. Currently, BNB is trading at $315.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>BNB Price Action Analysis</strong></h2>



<p>Taking a look at the 4-hour chart, we see BNB price having support at $185 on June and moving within an upward channel. Yesterday, Binance Coin peaked all the way up to $320 yet failed to surpass this level.</p>



<p>For now, the $305 level near the SMA100 is the first support level for BNB price. In case of a successful support, Binance Coin can continue the bullish trend. For the bullish scenario, the $325 is the first resistance level followed by $340. Following that, the $350 and $370 are the next key resistance levels for the price. Breaking them would pave the way to regain the $400 level.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if BNB price fails to surpass $320 and subsequently loses the $300 level, there could be further correction to follow.</p>



<p>For the bearish scenario, the $290 will be the next support level. In case of losing this level, the $270 will be next to support Binance Coin.</p>

<p>BNB price had a strong dip on February 20<sup>th</sup> and lost the $400 and $395 support levels then reached $350 on February 22<sup>nd</sup>. At that level, the price found support and climbed as high as $385 but once again failed to surpass and turned down. Following the strong plunge on February 23<sup>rd</sup> amid the Russian invasion on Ukraine, BNB price fell down to $335. However, the $330 level did not let Binance Coin fall further. With that, the price had a rebound and surpassed the $360 resistance level as well as the SMA100 yesterday. Today, BNB price reached all the way up to $380 but failed to break through. Currently, BNB is trading at $375.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>BNB Price Action Analysis</strong></h2>



<p>Taking a look at the 4-hour chart, we see BNB price finding support at $330 and turning green. Following that, the price bounced back and surpassed the $365 resistance level and peaked at $385.</p>



<p>Currently, the $375 is the first support level for Binance Coin which could eventually push BNB to retest $385. In case of a successful break through, the next resistance level will be at $400 which is a key level. After that, we can expect $410 to be the next resistance level.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if BNB price fails to surpass $380 and subsequently lose the $370 level, further correction will follow.</p>



<p>For the bearish scenario, the $360 near the SMA100 and 50% Fibonacci retracement level will be the key support level. Further decline can bring Binance Coin as low as $340.</p>

<p>BNB price hit a barrier at $435 last week and had to back down. Following that, the price lost the $420, $410 and $400 support levels and settled on $375. Subsequently, BNB finally found support at that point and did not have further decline. Therefore, it started a recover process. Currently, BNB Price is around $390.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">Buy and Sell Binance Coin anonymously on <a href="http://www.hi.exchange/">jolixo</a>.</span></p></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>BNB Price Action Analysis</strong></h2>



<p>Taking a look at the 4-hour chart, we see BNB had a rejection from the trendline at $430 and had a sharp plunge at almost 10%. By losing the key support level at $400, BNB fell as low as $375 before finally having support from the buyers and an attempt for recovery.</p>



<p>Today, after surpassing the $380, BNB started a new uptrend and is currently facing the $390 resistance level. In case of a successful break through, the next resistance levels are at $400, the SMA100 and the 50% Fibonacci retracement level. By surpassing this key level, the next resistance level is at $420.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if BNB fails to surpass $390 and $400, there could be further price correction to follow. For the bearish scenario, the $380 is the first support level. In case of losing this crucial level, the next stop will be at $360 while further decline can bring the price down to $340.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-buy-binance-coin-bnb-with-perfect-money"><strong>Why Buy Binance Coin (BNB) with Perfect Money?</strong></h2>



<p>Perfect Money is an e-currency for making payments on the internet. It is widely accepted as payment option by countless platforms. With Perfect Money, you can do a lot! Be it transferring funds to others or pay for goods and services. Or how about buying cryptocurrencies or even buying fiat currencies. It is a seriously popular payment method for online users. An additional capability is to loan and receipt issuance throughout the system.</p>



<p>The biggest downside of Perfect Money, however, is that you cannot cash Perfect money to your bank account on its website directly. For that, you will need a platform like CoinCannon to exchange your Perfect Money to PayPal and other e-currencies.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-to-buy-binance-coin-bnb-with-perfect-money"><strong>How to Buy Binance Coin (BNB) with Perfect Money?</strong></h2>



<p>All it takes is 5 easy steps:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Step 1 : Enter the homepage first, then select Perfect Money and Binance Coin from the options in the first step. Enter the amount you want to exchange. Following that, the amount of BNB you will receive will automatically calculate.</li>



<li>Step 2 : Press Exchange and you will go to the next stage where you will enter your BNB wallet details, email, and phone number.</li>



<li>Step 3 : One more time, click on the “Exchange” button and you will go to the next step where you will review your order.</li>

</ul>

<p>When you finish the steps above, our team will immediately process your order and send the funds to your wallet. The process might take a short while.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-jolixo-is-better"><strong>CoinCannon is Better!</strong></h2>



<p>Essentially, you need three primary qualities in an ideal exchange platform. Anonymity, good rates and reliability. </p>



<p>The <a href="https://hi.exchange/">jolixo</a> team consists of traders and professionals who have felt the need for an ideal exchange and pursued their vision.</p>



<p>First and foremost, all users need to protect their personal information especially when it comes down to financial transactions. Unfortunately, a vast majority of exchange apps and platforms make massive profits off of selling user data. Best case scenario, they are legally bound to disclose user information with national authorities for any reason. </p>



<p>In that regard, the best method to protect your privacy is to not disclose them with anyone at all. CoinCannon does not require customers to go through KYC (know your customer) or even a mandatory sign up. In that regard, it is simply as safe as one can get making an exchange.</p>



<p>On the other hand, privacy is not a reason to pay more on your exchange. With that in mind, the platform offers some of the most competitive exchange rates you can find anywhere. Don’t take our word for it. You can simply pay a visit to ranking websites such as BestChange or OkChanger and see compare our rates with others.</p>

<p>BNB price found its initial support at $340 on January 24<sup>th</sup> and started a new uptrend. Subsequently, Binance coin managed to surpass $300, $380 and finally $400. With that, it peaked at $430 and went for a price correction that brought it down to $405. Currently, the price is around $415.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">Buy and Sell Binance Coin (BNB) anonymously on <a href="http://www.hi.excahnge/">jolixo</a>.</span></p></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>BNB Price Action Analysis</strong></h2>



<p>Taking a look at the 4-hour chart, we see BNB managed to find support at $340 and started to recover. Following that, by reaching $360 on February 3<sup>rd</sup>, BNB had a rally that surpassed the SMA100 and $385 resistance level. Binance coin managed to reach $430 with the rally.</p>



<p>At that point, the price faced a barrier and had to back down. After that, it dipped as low as $410 and $405 but yet again the buyers rose to support it.</p>



<p>For the time being, the $430 is the first resistance level for BNB followed by the $440 to $450 zone. In case of a successful break through, we can expect BNB to shoot for $475, $490 and $500.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if BNB price fails to surpass $430, there could be a price correction to follow. For the bearish scenario, the first support level is at $405. Then, the 50% Fibonacci retracement level at the $400 to $395 zone and then the SMA100 at $390 will have to support the price. Further decline can bring BNB price as low as $380 and $375.</p>

<p>Are you ready for a better and safer exchange experience? You can exchange Binance Coin to PayPal on CoinCannon with the lowest exchange fees. CoinCannon offers full anonymity for customers and does not require KYC or sing up. Binance Coin is the native token of the Binance exchange which is by far the most popular exchange app. Considering the massive number of ICOs as well as other projects, BNB is a popular investment for crypto lovers. However, due to various regulations, Binance has limited access for numerous countries. Well, CoinCannon does not discriminate. You can easily and anonymously exchange Binance Coin to PayPal with awesome exchange rates!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><span style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">Head over to <a href="http://www.hi.exchange/">jolixo</a> to start!</span></p></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-binance-coin-bnb"><strong>What is Binance Coin (BNB)?</strong></h2>



<p>Initially found in China, Binance began as an online cryptocurrency exchange with a strong emphasis on altcoin trading. It didn’t take long for Binance to be crowned as the number one exchange in the world. Amongst the numerous motivating factors and reasons for this profound success, the primary one were high liquidity, low transaction fees and additional discounts for users who made payments by its native coin, BNB. The massive platform has a staggering capacity to process approximately 1.4 million orders per second, offering trading for more than 500 cryptocurrencies and virtual tokens.</p>



<p>As for trading, Binance offers seven trade orders of Limit order, Market order, stop limit order, stop market order, Trailing stop order, Post only order and Limit TP/SL order. Despite the varying transaction fees for withdrawal based on the currency and its amount, there is no transaction fee for deposits.</p>



<p>Initially introduced as an ERC20 Ethereum based cryptocurrency in 2017, BNB has now moved on to Binance’s own blockchain named Binance chain. As the native coin for Binance exchange, BNB was primarily a utility token to motivate users for transaction fee discounts. However, the applications for Binance coin have now expanded dramatically since you can now use Binance Coin for financial services, entertainment, online services and many more.</p>



<p>With all this development happening in a short time period, the 26,500% overall price increase (correct as of January 2022) since being introduced in 2017 is well justified. As of June 4th 2021 BNB has a market cap of $58.54 billion dollars and is only ranked behind Bitcoin and Ethereum.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-exchange-binance-coin-to-paypal"><strong>Why Exchange Binance Coin to PayPal?</strong></h2>



<p>PayPal is an online trade company that, through online transfers, facilitates payments between parties. Its system allows clients to set up an account on its platform that is linked to the user’s credit card or checking account. Upon confirmation of identification and proof of funds, through the website or application of the company, users can begin sending or receiving payments online to and from other PayPal accounts.</p>



<p>As mentioned above, in order to transfer money to others using the receiver’s email address or mobile phone number, PayPal account holders can use the website or mobile application of the company. Within only a matter of minutes, transactions go through and the company promises that transfers are immediately available for payment or withdrawal to a bank account.</p>



<p>The ease of use and the wide acceptance makes the exchange cryptocurrencies to PayPal one of the best options when you need some cash to spend online.</p>



<p>All that said, you also have the ability to exchange Binance Coin to Perfect Money USD, Payeer USD or Webmoney USD.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-jolixo-is-better"><strong>CoinCannon is Better!</strong></h2>



<p>Cryptocurrencies are not the same as before. Countless regulations are setting limit to a seemingly free form of finance. Unfortunately, Binance has to abide by so many different rules and regulations in order to maximize profit. The same goes for other big exchange apps since they’re all following the same road. These regulations limit the customers in so many different forms. Some countries like the United States require transaction information for transfers over a certain amount. In that regard, exchange apps are bound to share customer’s personal information with the government.</p>



<p>CoinCannon does not ask for your personal information so there will be no way to share it with anyone. You will have a fully anonymous transaction on CoinCannon.</p>



<p>But this anonymity should not come as a luxury. Subsequently, we offer some of the lowest exchange fees you can find anywhere. Don’t believe it? Check out websites such as BesChange or OkChanger and see our competitive rates for yourself.</p>
