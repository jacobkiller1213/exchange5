<p>If you’re looking to know how to buy Polkadot with Perfect Money look no further as we will provide a full 2024 guide and the best platform to make the exchange. </p>



<p>DOT has been amongst the very best altcoins in the past two years. Utilizing a revolutionary idea as well as great leadership by Gavin Wood, the network is reaching new heights. </p>



<p>In this article, we will guide you on how to buy Polkadot with Perfect Money and to avoid sky-high exchange rates. Furthermore, you don’t have to share your personal information with the platform unlike big trading apps.</p>



<p>Get started right now, head over to <a href="http://www.hi.exchange/">jolixo</a> to buy DOT.</p>



<div class="wp-block-buttons is-content-justification-center is-layout-flex wp-container-core-buttons-is-layout-1 wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex">
<div class="wp-block-button is-style-outline is-style-outline--1"><a class="wp-block-button__link has-black-color has-text-color has-background has-link-color wp-element-button" href="http://www.hi.exchange/" style="background-color:#f49d3f">Buy <strong>DOT</strong> with <strong>Perfect Money</strong> Right Now!</a></div>
</div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-buy-polkadot-with-perfect-money"><strong>Why Buy Polkadot with Perfect Money?</strong></h2>



<p>Perfect Money is an e-currency used for making payments on the internet. It is widely accepted as payment option by countless platforms. With Perfect Money, you can do a lot! Be it transferring funds to others or pay for goods and services. Or how about buying cryptocurrencies or even buying fiat currencies. It is a seriously popular payment method for online users. An additional capability is to loan and receipt issuance throughout the system.</p>



<p>The biggest downside of Perfect Money, however, is that you cannot cash Perfect money to your bank account on its website directly. For that, you will need a platform like CoinCannon to exchange your Perfect Money to PayPal and other e-currencies.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-to-buy-polkadot-with-perfect-money"><strong>How to Buy Polkadot with Perfect Money?</strong></h2>



<p>Here are the five easy steps to make the purchase:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Step 1 : </strong>Enter the homepage first, then select Perfect Money and Polkadot from the options in the first step. Enter the amount you want to exchange. Following that, the amount of DOT you will receive will automatically calculate.</li>



<li><strong>Step 2 : </strong>Press Exchange and you will go to the next stage where you will enter your Polkadot wallet details, email, and phone number.</li>



<li><strong>Step 3 : </strong>One more time, click on the “Exchange” button and you will go to the next step where you will review your order.</li>



<li><strong>Step 4 : </strong>Complete the captcha and click on exchange to go to the next step where you will obtain a tracking ID. Press the “Pay Order” button to go to the Perfect Money gateway and make the payment to our Perfect Money account. Having transferred your Perfect Money to CoinCannon, your order will process very quickly.</li>



<li><strong>Step 5 : </strong>By finishing all the steps above, our team of professionals will send the Polkadot to your wallet ASAP.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-that-was-easy"><strong>That Was Easy!</strong></h2>



<p>The sales team will immediately process the exchange and make the DOT payment to your wallet. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-to-choose-jolixo"><strong>Why to choose CoinCannon?</strong></h2>



<p><a href="http://www.hi.exchange/">jolixo</a> was found with the vision to create a solid exchange platform that offers everything the customers need. And the platform successfully dealt with all the challenges. Ideally speaking, an online exchange must offer privacy, efficiency and reliability altogether.</p>



<p>Cryptocurrencies are losing the anonymity as more and more institutions continue to sell user data to both regulators and the highest bidders. To prevent your data from getting in the wrong hands, the best method is to not share it with unnecessary platforms. In that regard, CoinCannon platform respects customer privacy by not asking for it at all. No KYC or sign up is mandatory on the website.</p>



<p>Protecting your privacy on the other hand is not a luxury. In that regard, it is not easy to find an exchange that offers both privacy and low exchange rates simultaneously. However, CoinCannon has managed to offer both at the same time. The exchange rates are competitive as you can see for yourself on ranking websites such as BestChange and OkChanger.</p>



<p>Last but not least, reliability is a proof of work that comes with experience. The platform offers 24/7 customer support to ensure all potential problems are immediately dealt with.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Here is a statistic, the Bitcoin blockchain network consumes as much as 8.6 million times what the US average household uses in electricity. Now, nobody in their right mind can believe that this will go on without hard hitting regulations. To be honest, considering the power outages in so many countries due to Bitcoin mining, people are turning against cryptocurrencies. Thankfully, altcoins are doing much better in terms of power consumption. On the other hand, Bitcoin maintains a massive dominance over the market. Hence, here is the conflict in our crypto story, Bitcoin is the old drunken king while altcoins are reaching for the crown. Amongst the gallant altcoins, the Polkadot network turns out to be the most energy efficient. In fact, the Polkadot network only consumes 6.6 times an average US household.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">Buy Polkadot on <a href="http://www.hi.exchange/">jolixo</a> to save the Planet!</span></p></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Polkadot Network Leads the Pack</strong></h2>



<p>According to a new <a href="https://www.carbon-ratings.com/dl/pos-report-2022" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a> by Crypto Carbon Ratings Institute (CCRI), the Polkadot network consumes the least amount of electricity. In the meantime, Bitcoin remains the polluting champion while Ethereum is as always in the second position.</p>



<p>Based on the data, DOT consumes only 6.6 times as much as an average household in electricity. Clearly, the sophisticated twist on the proof-of-stake blockchain network is the reason why, Nonetheless, it turns out not all blockchain networks are made equal.</p>



<p>As for the next best options, Tezos, Avalanche, Algorand, Cardano and Solana are following DOT’s lead.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="557" src="https://blog.hi.exchange/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Power-1024x557.jpg" alt="Polkadot Network" class="wp-image-4816" srcset="https://hi.exchange/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Power-1024x557.jpg 1024w, https://hi.exchange/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Power-300x163.jpg 300w, https://hi.exchange/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Power-768x418.jpg 768w, https://hi.exchange/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Power.jpg 1208w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p><em>“An average US household consumes about 10,600 kWh per year and therefore, the least electricity consuming network Polkadot consumes about 6.6 times the electricity and the most electricity consuming network Solana about 200 times the electricity (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2021. Bitcoin consumes much more electricity than any Proof of Stake system due to its Proof of Work consensus mechanism, resulting in the deployment of energy-intensive hardware.”</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Winter is Coming</strong></h2>



<p>Forget about what Cathie Wood and Michael Saylor and Pomp say about Bitcoin. Today, as of early 2022, the world is facing a huge energy crisis, environmental crisis, greenflation, record high gas and oil prices, historical supply-chain issues as well as multiple other lurking in the dark. Bitcoin mining goes against every effort to deal with all the above-mentioned issues. As Bitcoin grows in value, the volatility remains higher than ever. In that sense, a new wave of regulatory actions against BTC mining can seriously harm Bitcoin. Subsequently, a sharp plunge caused by regulations can also wipe out numerous innocent altcoins because of Bitcoin dominance.</p>



<p>The only remedy for the crypto market is in fact the highly efficient proof of stake algorithm. The Polkadot network maintains a good reputation in terms of reliability and scalability and now it is the most energy efficient. This news may not have a strong positive effect on DOT price but it is a significant achievement for the whole blockchain industry.</p>



<p>You can learn everything about Polkadot and its native token DOT on “<a href="https://blog.hi.exchange/what-is-polkadot/">What is Polkadot?</a>”</p>
