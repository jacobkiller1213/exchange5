<p>Whether you’re a trader or an avid investor, there are solid reasons to buy Tether USDT. As of 2023, USDT has a lot more utility than what it had only a few years ago. Basically, the dollar-pegged cryptocurrency is accepted in a wide variety of online platforms for shopping and services. Today, you can pay for almost anything from flight bookings to a Cappuccino with Tether. On the other hand, Forex traders have also been using Tether as a medium on their traders. However, if you are looking to Buy Tether USDT, not all exchanges are equal! For that, you will need an exchange platform that offers the best exchange rates. And more importantly, a platform who doesn’t sell you private data to the highest bidder! Fortunately, <a href="http://www.hi.exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jolixo</a> is the ultimate OTC platform to buy Tether USDT from and this article will tell you why.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><mark style="background-color:#ffffff" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">Learn <a href="https://blog.hi.exchange/exchange-crypto-to-tether/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How to Exchange Crypto to Tether</a> on CoinCannon</mark></p></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-tether-usdt"><strong>What is Tether USDT?</strong></h2>



<p>Before reading about how to buy Tether USDT, let’s take a quick look at what Tether is and how it operates. Tether is a cryptocurrency based on blockchain whose crypto coins in use are backed by an equivalent amount of traditional fiat currencies, such as the Dollar, Euro, or Japanese Yen that is retained in a specific bank account. The Tether tokens, the Tether network’s native tokens, trade under the USDT symbol.</p>



<p>In contrast to the wide swings observed in the prices of other popular cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, Tether belongs to a new race of cryptocurrencies called stablecoins that aims to keep cryptocurrency valuations stable. Instead of being used as a means of speculative investment, this would allow Tether to be used as a medium of exchange and a mode of storage of value.</p>



<p>Tether was specifically developed to create the necessary CoinCannon between fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies, providing users with stability, transparency, and minimum transaction fees. It is pegged against the US dollar and, in terms of value, maintains a 1-to-1 ratio with USD. There is, however, no guarantee provided by Tether Ltd. for any right to redeem or exchange real money for Tethers, i.e. Tethers cannot be exchanged for U.S. Dollars.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-should-i-buy-tether-usdt"><strong>Why Should I Buy Tether USDT?</strong></h2>



<p>Owning Tether is basically like having digital dollars in your pocket, only without needing a bank. Recently, there has been lots of talk about how we do not actually own our money when they are in the banks. Digital money means that banks and governments can freeze our access to our funds for whatever reason they seem justifiable. In 2022, Canada denied protestor’s access to their bank accounts and cut out their rightful ownership of their capital. Such incidents are not rare and should be treated seriously. But, political motivation aside, banks are not always available. For example, we saw how the Ukrainians lost all their capital within the banks as soon as the war started. Once again, the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies meant that the bankless were the lucky ones in that incident.</p>



<p>Thankfully, the list of online merchants and service providers who accept Tether USDT is sufficiently long. With Tether, you can make purchases online and in person almost anywhere. Be it through a direct wallet address or a payment gateway, USDT is as good as cash these days.</p>



<p>Lastly, USDT offers an extra layer of protection for the user with blockchain technology. As a cryptocurrency, it is anonymous and secure. On top of that, the transaction fees for Tether are very low, as long as you use the TRC20 variant based on the Tron network.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-where-do-i-buy-usdt"><strong>Where Do I Buy USDT?</strong></h2>



<p>Every exchange platform must maintain three important characteristics. Anonymity, affordability and reliability. We pride ourselves as a professional platform that offers all three.</p>



<p>For anonymity, <a href="http://www.hi.exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jolixo</a> requires no KYC or even a sign up process. The best way to protect your information is to not share them with anyone. And for that, we respect our customers and do not ask for their personal info.</p>



<p>As for affordability, CoinCannon utilizes an automated system to determine the best exchange rates at any moment. By doing so, we have managed to stay on top of the ranks on websites such as Bestchange and OkChanger.</p>



<p>Lastly, reliability is ensured for our customers with 24/7 online support. In case anything goes wrong, you will have our immediate support until the issue is resolved.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-tether-a-safe-investment"><strong>Is Tether a Safe Investment?</strong></h2>



<p>Generally speaking, Tether has remained reliable and solid since the initial introduction. While there are numerous controversies, USDT has been consistently stern as an investment option. Most of the controversies come from a lack of transparency regarding Tether’s funds. Basically, there is not much information about what funds are actually held by Tether to back their stablecoin. However, Tether has assured investors that they hold the majority of their funds in the form of cash and investors have no reason to worry.</p>



<p>Regardless, there is still some risk associated with stablecoins, especially after the Terra USD collapse. With that, while there is no clear and imminent risk, make sure to thread carefully and keep some of the risks in mind before you buy Tether USDT.</p>
