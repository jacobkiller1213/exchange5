<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-iota"><strong>What is IOTA?</strong></h2>



<p>To explain IOTA, we must first discuss distributed ledgers. A distributed ledger is simply a database that is shared by multiple participants like sites, servers, institutions etc. It is essentially a network within which the transactions can be witnessed and saved by all participants.</p>



<p>IOTA is a distributed ledger which executes and records the transactions between devices and computers in the internet of things (IoT) ecosystem. In simpler terms, it is a network that utilizes its own cryptocurrency called MIOTA for transactions.</p>



<p>In terms of utility, it benefits from a massively improved scalability and transaction speed. The platform has a system of nodes (proof of stake) for consensus called Tangle.</p>



<p>As of December 2021, MIOTA is currently ranked as the 47th cryptocurrency with a market cap of $3.2 billion.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-buy-iota-with-payeer"><strong>Why Buy IOTA with Payeer?</strong></h2>



<p>First and foremost, Payeer is considered an online digital wallet for better asset management. Be it crypto of fiat, the payment processor is quick, reliable and cheap. In that regard, in a short lifespan of almost 8 years, Payeer is now recognized as one of the very best amongst competitors. Payeer utilizes built-in payment services with giant financial services such as Mastercard, VISA and PayPal.</p>



<p>As of 2021, the Payeer has approximately 7 million users which can transfer funds to each other with extremely low fees. The strength however, lies in diversity. Payeer is far ahead of any similar platform in terms of scale of operation and diversity in supported payment methods. With more than 50 payment approaches, the Payeer wallet offers users various services in one place.</p>

By the end of this guide, you&#8217;ll have the knowledge to confidently <strong>purchase IOTA</strong> using Perfect Money. </p>



<p>Let&#8217;s explore the exciting possibilities of buying IOTA with Perfect Money in 2024!</p>

<div class="wp-block-button is-style-outline is-style-outline--1"><a class="wp-block-button__link has-black-color has-text-color has-background has-link-color wp-element-button" href="https://hi.exchange/" style="background-color:#f49d3f">Buy IOTA with Perfect Money Right Now!</a></div>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-buy-iota-with-perfect-money"><strong>Why Buy IOTA with Perfect Money?</strong></h2>



<p>Perfect Money is an e-currency used for making payments on the internet. It is widely accepted as payment option by countless platforms. With Perfect Money, you can do a lot! Be it transferring funds to others or pay for goods and services. Or how about buying cryptocurrencies or even buying fiat currencies. It is a seriously popular payment method for online users. An additional capability is to loan and receipt issuance throughout the system.</p>



<p>The biggest downside of Perfect Money, however, is that you cannot cash Perfect money to your bank account on its website directly. For that, you will need a platform like CoinCannon to exchange your Perfect Money to PayPal and other e-currencies.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-to-buy-iota-with-perfect-money"><strong>How to Buy IOTA with Perfect Money</strong></h2>



<p>There are five easy steps for this process:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Enter the homepage first, then select Perfect Money and IOTA (MIOTA) from the options in the first step. Enter the amount you want to exchange. Following that, the amount of IOTA you will receive will automatically calculate.</li>



<li>Press Exchange and you will go to the next stage where you will enter your IOTA wallet details, email, and phone number.</li>



<li>One more time, click on the “Exchange” button and you will go to the next step where you will review your order.</li>



<li>Complete the captcha and click on exchange to go to the next step where you will obtain a tracking ID. Press the “Pay Order” button to go to the Perfect Money gateway and make the payment to our Perfect Money account. Having transferred your Perfect Money to CoinCannon, your order will process very quickly.</li>



<li>By finishing all the steps above, our team of professionals will send the IOTA to your wallet as soon as possible</li>
</ul>

<p>When you finish the steps above, our team will immediately follow up your order and make the payment to your wallet. The process might take a short while.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-jolixo-platform"><strong>CoinCannon Platform</strong></h2>

<p><a href="https://hi.exchange/">jolixo</a> seeks to be a platform that offers privacy and efficiency simultaneously while offering some of the most aggressive exchange rates in the market.</p>



<p>To make this happen, the platform does not require KYC or a sign up process. This way, all customers can easily make transactions without a possible compromise on their personal information.</p>



<p>However, privacy is a crucial element and not a luxury. In that regard, the platform offers some of the most competitive rates amongst all online exchanges. The rates ar automatically determined utilizing an automated system and are updated as soon as change in value is detected.</p>
