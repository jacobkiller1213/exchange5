<p>Looking for the best platform to exchange Dogecoin to Tether? CoinCannon is all you need. For the past two years, DOGE has been a hot topic of conversation. Despite all the huge growth in short periods of time, Dogecoin remains as a highly volatile crypto asset. In that regard, most investors tend to convert DOGE to Tether USDT in case they’re looking to hold assets for a while. However, it’s not easy to find an anonymous exchange platform that offers low exchange fees. In this article, we will go over everything you need to know on how to exchange Dogecoin to Tether USDT.</p>



<p>So, get started! Head over to <a href="http://www.hi.exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jolixo</a>, select Dogecoin and Tether on the box and you’re good to go.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Learn <a href="https://hi.exchange/blog/exchange-cryptocurrency-to-paypal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How to Exchange Cryptocurrency to PayPal</a></p></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What Do I Need to Exchange Dogecoin to Tether?</strong></h2>



<p>For this exchange, you will need a crypto wallet to receive USDT. Most likely, your Dogecoin wallet supports USDT, so you can also receive funds in the same wallet. Make sure that you are using a reliable crypto wallet to hold your assets. On the other hand, for CoinCannon platform, all you need is an email address. CoinCannon does not require KYC (know your customer) or sign up. However, there are benefits and rewards for those who <a href="https://hi.exchange/blog/reasosn-sign-up-jolixo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sign up on CoinCannon</a>. How do you like winning $100 gifts ever single month?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is Dogecoin (DOGE)?</strong></h2>



<p>Dogecoin started off as somewhat of a joke, but it developed a following after it was created. By the end of 2017, Dogecoin was a part of the cryptocurrency bubble that sent up the prices of several coins dramatically. Dogecoin lost much of its value after the bubble burst in 2018, but it still has a core of supporters who trade it and use it to tip Twitter and Reddit content.</p>



<p>Dogecoin (DOGE) is an open-source, peer-to-peer cryptocurrency. It is called an altcoin and as mentioned, many believe it is an almost sarcastic meme coin. Although it was seemingly developed as a joke, the blockchain of Dogecoin still has value. It derives its underlying technology from Litecoin. The low price and infinite supply of Dogecoin are noteworthy features of this cryptocurrency, which uses a scrypt algorithm.</p>



<p>You can read more about <a href="https://hi.exchange/blog/what-is-dogecoin-how-it-work/">What is Dogecoin</a> at our article fully dedicated to this Cryptocurrency in case you need to do your research about this coin.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why Exchange Dogecoin to Tether?</strong></h2>



<p>At this point, it’s good to briefly introduce Tether. Tether is a cryptocurrency based on blockchain whose crypto coins in use are backed by an equivalent amount of traditional fiat currencies, such as the Dollar, Euro, or Japanese Yen that is retained in a specific bank account. The Tether tokens, the Tether network’s native tokens, trade under the USDT symbol.</p>



<p>In contrast to the wide swings observed in the prices of other popular cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, Tether belongs to a new race of cryptocurrencies called stablecoins that aims to keep cryptocurrency valuations stable. Instead of being used as a means of speculative investment, this would allow Tether to be used as a medium of exchange and a mode of storage of value.</p>



<p>Tether was specifically developed to create the necessary CoinCannon between fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies, providing users with stability, transparency, and minimum transaction fees. It is pegged against the US dollar and, in terms of value, maintains a 1-to-1 ratio with USD. There is, however, no guarantee provided by Tether Ltd. for any right to redeem or exchange real money for Tethers, i.e. Tethers cannot be exchanged for U.S. Dollars.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>CoinCannon Platform</strong></h2>

<p>There is a literary theory called formalism which is pretty boring but has a practical message. One should take everything at face value instead of acknowledging endless extrinsic benefactors. Now, taking Elon’s clownery on Twitter at face value, he was undoubtedly promoting a Dogecoin pyramid scheme. But guess what, nobody can prove it just like nobody can prove Epstein didn’t kill himself. Today, the world of finance is taking a serious beating from social media due to well-coordinated pumps and dumps. And Elon, standing on top of the world, is running his own Dogecoin pyramid scheme to compensate for all of his far-fetched projects. After all, someone has to raise trillions of dollars to send humans to mars where extreme solar radiation will give you cancer. However, one investor has sued Elon and his companies for a lot of money and all we can say to him is Godspeed!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><mark style="background-color:#ffffff" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">Buy and Sell Dogecoin Instantly on <a href="http://www.hi.exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jolixo</a><br>No KYC</mark></p></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dogecoin-pyramid-scheme"><strong>Dogecoin Pyramid Scheme</strong></h2>



<p>Ha ha it’s so funny, Elon posted a meme on Twitter. Welp, Keith Johnson doesn’t think so. Mr. Johnson has bravely sued the meme mongering clown billionaire and his companies for a fair $258 billion. Basically, he is claiming that they promoted a Dogecoin pyramid scheme with their support for DOGE.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://assets2.pacermonitor.com/filings/Johnson_v_Musk_et_al/Johnson_v_Musk_et_al__nysdce-22-05037__0001.0.pdf?X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjELn%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEaCXVzLWVhc3QtMSJHMEUCICe8v9QbE5ucxkNw%2F4uIyKQkjJprelAClmtWXaGaR63yAiEAmtTds26Or20TjflZQuFt8E5KHvARjGVAJVpAzkBd4iYq3AQIwv%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FARADGgw5MjQ2NTE0MDgzOTgiDHdleGUYt3IzNA4WxCqwBMxc7LYGv%2F3FmkzepvB1iEhKy4WrV60iR%2BC6sgRWd7KRvpeKutlBGRhY%2BSpmfSN2P5eTxK1sprMAOk4RMJbwXMB2IwFCatBro0IJPS26eMo3TpqDLwCVQAfqVqTxlvqdgOv%2Fvesj6yET6XWuPEY08iW2ZbF%2F9fqXXy3ujKokd2%2BOMPORrbBGZ3wYx5E1Ux7GsuU7a55EJfmihcgkf22mcb2yW%2F25nolZn26PATe1SVfwfc%2BJPOFpch%2BpIDZDINfzNgnYW%2BNc60KcB%2FWBluXiuINNUw%2FqBPcx4FgwyAyTTt0%2BbPFpQnYc%2FzQ9XDwgOOge%2FK8mT3q3svyKADAW4LOmGnjxCMshOnxLrcWVA5pdQT6Xp1V56%2Br%2BSXD986u3EHnCTGoTiIP311bCYq1o4pcpjdcrCZE%2F%2F3rtF%2FehTr%2By3Iy9%2FdH3Dbp4RUl7%2BP16eOQvUeCCEukWX8M9OgFLYcvrdsAox1l%2Fw%2FUQ3dfLYpia7fVObcoo%2FRUN8ak85FMqBkgyKGB7mfCqDLM6vU%2Bw5Hianz3hWo9WuCcTEvKsqv%2FY6L0rIAC1uFw%2FC%2F4%2F%2Bs3qDpJhu%2BnvZGCCGv9%2FVPfjwvAI9XcQ6%2Bc2TC7kx5%2BPm7PyY0SKBM5C4a6JTMPcKog44sq9HTTeMawq1fBvsbBITYxKmjxRuE4rFCn2seFta5Elc54qv1Y0X5P0oQkjOESiNWyArByjoh4KLwtS9xiAA9Uh5Av0sFrFeGm5LKvXQaQz5YXAMOG6rZUGOqkB0oSanITZYUmLZlbgCjFCckfK8%2FTGfAR1DMznAy%2FFM1HNAh9Bi6glBFifnM68QF9sBoXrOZOICHPvTnPyEPQjClub0Bg1Fj9%2BH%2FL3rYsdeci303GLJtGoeuG5dMfIQI9hzTVw7qOi81%2FF68mt0OeLODNJNcw2j1nyQmb8%2FfWKut0BOzkDDZIchN9jIbI3ViOdimrq960jFJj7YVWSOD%2FrDKyHANsocddz9A%3D%3D&amp;X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Date=20220616T172931Z&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;X-Amz-Expires=599&amp;X-Amz-Credential=ASIA5OSMEZQHHGKLHKVM%2F20220616%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Signature=e89dbab48532f1335e571cea705859ffa86dd08c2139a572d86c7cdbfb8c62c4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">court documents</a>, Keith Johnson argues that Dogecoin is “simply a fraud whereby greater fools are deceived into buying a coin at a higher price. The documents are currently held with the US district court in southern district of New York.</p>



<p>Johnson is calling for the court to clarify the case as a class-action lawsuit. With that, he is asking for $86 billion in damages for the class, as well as $172 billion for treble damages.</p>



<p>Initially, Keith Johnson argues that Elon and his companies utilized “unethical, torturous and criminal conduct in promoting Dogecoin. Hence, billions of investors lost billions of dollars into the Dogecoin pyramid scheme. As for the numbers, Johnson states that musk made $86 billion “as a result of their wire fraud, gambling enterprise, false advertising, deceptive practices, and other unlawful conduct.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Too Vague, and Silly!</h2>



<p>Billionaire Elon Musk is seeking to have the multi-billion-dollar lawsuit against him dismissed, which alleges he illegally promoted Dogecoin pyramid scheme. The lawsuit, which was filed by a group of investors, accuses Musk of perpetrating a scandal.</p>



<p>Attorneys representing the Tesla CEO are arguing that the lawsuit is baseless, and Musk&#8217;s statements about Dogecoin were too vague and silly to be considered actual endorsements of the cryptocurrency. Additionally, the lawyers contend that DOGE is a legitimate cryptocurrency with a market cap of around $10 billion. </p>



<p>Musk&#8217;s legal team stated, &#8220;There is nothing unlawful about tweeting words of support for or funny pictures about a legitimate cryptocurrency that continues to hold a market cap of nearly $10 billion. This court should dismiss the complaint and put a stop to plaintiffs&#8217; fantasy.&#8221; this statement matters a lot. Because apparently the court is dealing with a bunch of 12 year olds in this lawsuit!</p>



<p>The lawsuit filed by investors claims that Musk purposely drove the price of Dogecoin up by 36,000% over a two-year period before letting it crash. The suit also alleges that Dogecoin was a security, and Musk knew that it had no intrinsic value.</p>



<p>In addition, the Dogecoin Foundation is another defendant in the lawsuit and is also seeking to have it dismissed.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-elongate"><strong>Elongate</strong></h2>



<p>Elon may be the richest man on earth, but, almost all of his wealth is tied up in stocks for his companies. And, ding ding ding, all his stocks are holding the biggest bubbles in history. Don’t believe it? Then why would Bill gates hold a $2-billion-dollar short position on Tesla? Despite Elon’s wealth, his companies are constantly desperate for cash flow because bubbles take lots of money to continue.</p>



<p>Previously, Elon has stated that he holds Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and Dogecoin (DOGE). To make it more interesting, he had previously <a href="https://blog.hi.exchange/elon-musk-says-the-us-should-do-nothing-about-crypto/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> that the US lawmakers should “do nothing” about crypto.</p>



<p>As to why he loves DOGE, he had said that it is the “people’s crypto”. You would think that in this day and age, communist style of deception would not work but you would be wrong. Today, everything is “people’s thing” everyone is doing it for “the people” just like the gulags were for the “people”.</p>



<p>In the world of insane maximalists and mislead retail investors, Elon’s Dogecoin pyramid scheme was an unfair one. While the current bear market is purging market from all the crazy NFT money and stimulus checks, Elon will continue to take from “the people”.</p>

<p>Dogecoin investors, the pilgrims of Elon’s journey to control the money of the future, are now laughing at SHIB holders. Now, whether it funny or not, one of the two rival memecoins is now doing much better for its investors. With that, older dogs hunt better as the majority of Dogecoin investors are still in profit. In the meantime, most Shiba holders are in the red which is how most altcoin holders are currently doing. New data from <a href="https://app.intotheblock.com/coin/DOGE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IntoTheBlock</a> reveals some interesting data that may indicate a bullish outlook for at least one of the two doggy coins.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Buy and Sell Dogecoin on <a href="http://www.hi.exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jolixo</a></p></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dogecoin-investors-in-profit"><strong>Dogecoin Investors in Profit</strong></h2>



<p>According to IntoTheBlock, a leading crypto analytics firm, around 63% of Dogecoin holders are still in profit. In the meantime, 35% are enduring losses while the rest are even.</p>



<p>Simultaneously, 45% of Shiba Inu investors are in profit while 47% are underwater. SHIB has been showing bullish sign since their announcement of building a layer-2 solution on Ethereum network. However, with the Ethereum 2.0, layer 2 solutions on the network do not make as much sense as the past. Regardless, for both DOGE and Shiba Inu, utility has never been top priority. Yes, the big element of success is the meme!</p>



<p>Speaking of memes and utility, there are strong rumors going around about a possible adoption of Dogecoin for Twitter payments. Now this, can jump start a pretty strong rally for DOGE in case of approval. Bear in mind, <a href="https://hi.exchange/blog/dogecoin-pyramid-sheme-elon/">Elon Musk</a> is still dealing with a lawsuit accusing him of running a pyramid scheme with Dogecoin. But that’s just Elon!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Bear Market</strong></h2>



<p>While there’s still debate on whether the latest Bitcoin rally is a bull trap or not, recent data shows an improving situation.</p>



<p>At the moment, a majority of Bitcoin and Ethereum holders are still in the green.</p>



<p>According to IntoTheBlock, 61% of BTC investors are in profit while 35% are underwater. BTC is currently trading at 23,380.</p>



<p>As for Ethereum, there is a similar situation with 62% in profit and 36% are enduring losses.</p>



<p>Fundamentally speaking, crypto investors are mostly dealing with an uncertain market. Unlike the pandemic days, there is no free money flowing into the market like the stimulus checks. On top of that, higher inflation will cause investors to be extra careful with their investment in crypto assets.</p>



<p>Following a bear market lasting for more than a year, crypto companies are at a critical point where they must prove their utility. In such times, memecoins and JPEGs are no longer appealing options for majority of people.</p>



<p>Perhaps, this is why both Shiba Inu and Dogecoin are getting their act together. However, Shiba with the layer 2 solution is embarrassingly behind what Dogecoin is cooking.</p>



<p>In case Elon pushes DOGE into the mainstream with Twitter, Dogecoin holders will be a lot happier that Shiba investors.</p>

<p>If your favorite breed of dog is Shiba Inu, then Dogecoin is right up your alley.</p>



<p>In this article, we will provide a step-by-step guide on<strong> how to buy DOGE with Perfect Money</strong> without having to go through KYC or sign up.</p>



<p> DOGE is the king of all meme coins but in terms of scalability and transaction fees, it is just as good as the others.</p>



<p>If you’re thinking of buying Dogecoin, CoinCannon is one of the best platforms you can find.</p>



<div class="wp-block-buttons is-content-justification-center is-layout-flex wp-container-core-buttons-is-layout-1 wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex">
<div class="wp-block-button is-style-outline is-style-outline--1"><a class="wp-block-button__link has-black-color has-text-color has-background has-link-color wp-element-button" href="https://hi.exchange/" style="background-color:#f49d3f">Buy <strong>DOGE</strong> with <strong>Perfect Money</strong> Right Now!</a></div>
</div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-buy-doge-with-perfect-money"><strong>Why Buy DOGE with Perfect Money?</strong></h2>



<p>Perfect Money is an e-currency used for making payments on the internet. It is widely accepted as payment option by countless platforms. With Perfect Money, you can do a lot! Be it transferring funds to others or pay for goods and services. Or how about buying cryptocurrencies or even buying fiat currencies. It is a seriously popular payment method for online users. An additional capability is to loan and receipt issuance throughout the system.</p>



<p>The biggest shortcoming of Perfect Money is that you cannot cash Perfect money to your bank account on its website directly. For that, you will need a platform like CoinCannon to exchange your Perfect Money to PayPal and other e-currencies.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-to-buy-doge-with-perfect-money"><strong>How to Buy DOGE with Perfect Money?</strong></h2>



<p>All you have to do is go through five simple steps.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">

<p>If you are looking to buy Dogecoin with Payeer, look no further than <a href="http://www.hi.exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jolixo</a>! With the best exchange rates in the game, full anonymity and 24/7 support, CoinCannon is the best platform to buy DOGE. Interestingly, Dogecoin is a different breed of crypto. In a volatile and unpredictable market, DOGE stands out as the one who does not follow the herd. Funny enough, DOGE has been defying all expectations with surprise bull runs and of course a cult following. Today, we will go over everything to know on how to buy Dogecoin with Payeer USD on CoinCannon platform.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><mark style="background-color:#ffffff" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">Learn How to <a href="https://blog.hi.exchange/buy-cryptocurrencies-with-payeer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Buy Cryptocurrency with Payeer</a></mark></p></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What Do I Need to Buy Dogecoin with Payeer?</strong></h2>



<p>Basically, you will need a verified and active Payeer account to send the funds. On the other hand, you will have to have a reliable crypto wallet that supports Dogecoin. Make sure to double check on your wallet address since crypto transactions are irreversible. As for CoinCannon, all you need is an email-address since no KYC (know your customer) is necessary. However, bear in mind that there are many advantages available for those who sign up on CoinCannon. Want a good reason why? How about winning $100 ever month!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is Dogecoin (DOGE)?</strong></h2>



<p>Dogecoin started off as somewhat of a joke, but it developed a following after it was created. By the end of 2017, Dogecoin was a part of the cryptocurrency bubble that sent up the prices of several coins dramatically. Dogecoin lost much of its value after the bubble burst in 2018, but it still has a core of supporters who trade it and use it to tip Twitter and Reddit content.</p>



<p>Dogecoin (DOGE) is an open-source, peer-to-peer cryptocurrency. It is called an altcoin and as mentioned, many believe it is an almost sarcastic meme coin. Although it was seemingly developed as a joke, the blockchain of Dogecoin still has value. It derives its underlying technology from Litecoin. The low price and infinite supply of Dogecoin are noteworthy features of this cryptocurrency, which uses a scrypt algorithm.</p>



<p>You can read more about <a href="https://blog.hi.exchange/what-is-dogecoin-how-it-work/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">What is Dogecoin</a> at our article fully dedicated to this Cryptocurrency in case you need to do your research about this coin.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why Buy Dogecoin with Payeer?</strong></h2>



<p>First and foremost, Payeer is considered an online digital wallet for better asset management. Be it crypto of fiat, the payment processor is quick, reliable and cheap. In that regard, in a short lifespan of almost 8 years, Payeer is now recognized as one of the very best amongst competitors. Payeer utilizes built-in payment services with giant financial services such as Mastercard, VISA and PayPal.</p>



<p>As of 2021, the Payeer has approximately 7 million users which can transfer funds to each other with extremely low fees. The strength however, lies in diversity. Payeer is far ahead of any similar platform in terms of scale of operation and diversity in supported payment methods. With more than 50 payment approaches, the Payeer wallet offers users various services in one place.</p>



<p>To learn more about Payeer, continue reading “<a href="https://blog.hi.exchange/what-is-payeer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">What is Payeer?</a>”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>CoinCannon to the Moon!</strong></h2>



<p>To exchange any cryptocurrency, you will need to find a good platform first. However, despite the diversity, it is quite a difficult task to find a good online exchange. The problem begins by compromising on your standards. You will want good exchange rates, privacy and reliability altogether. And that is hard to find!</p>



<p>Harsh regulations are pushing exchanges to disclose customer data to governments. This goes against the initial purpose of crypto which is absolute anonymity. Even worse, user data is a commodity, large institutions buy your information at a certain price. The best way to make sure your data is safe, is to not share them at all.</p>



<p>However, it is a luxury to offer no KYC, hence many exchanges charge customers with ridiculous exchange rates to compensate for the anonymity.</p>



<p>CoinCannon on the other hand gives you everything all at once. Want privacy? We have no KYC. Want the best exchange rates? Well, simply visit Bestchange or OkChanger and see for yourself how we are always on top of their lists.</p>



<p>And to make sure everything goes right, we offer 24/7 customer support.</p>

<p>DOGE price touched the $0.090 on August 16 but faced rejection and headed for a correction. With that, DOGE lost the $0.075 and $0.065 support levels and settled on $0.060 on September 1. Using the new found support, Dogecoin stabilized at this level and attempted to recover. Subsequently, Dogecoin reached all the way up to $0.060 but failed to break through this level. Currently, DOGE price is around $0.063.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><mark style="background-color:#ffffff" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">Buy and Sell DOGE Instantly on <a href="http://www.hi.exchange" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jolixo</a><br>No KYC</mark></p></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>DOGE Price Action Analysis</strong></h2>



<p>Taking a look at the 4-hour chart, we see DOGE inside a new upward channel. Consequently, DOGE reached the ceiling on August 16 at $0.090 and got rejected then fell down to $0.060.</p>



<p>Currently, the $0.060 is a key support level for Dogecoin. In case of providing good support, DOGE can bounce back and recover. For that, the $0.065 on the 50% Fibonacci retracement level will be the key resistance level for the price. After that, the $0.070, $0.075 and $0.080 are the next resistance levels.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if DOGE price fails to surpass $0.065 and loses the $0.060, we can expect further decline. For the bearish scenario, the $0.058, $0.055 and $0.050 will be the following support levels.</p>

<p>DOGE price found support at $0.060 on the trendline on July 26 and had a chance to bounce back. With that, the price surpassed $0.065 and $0.070 and reached $0.075 on July 30. At that point, the selling pressure increased and Dogecoin had to back down. Subsequently, it lost the $0.070 support and is currently trading at $0.066.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Buy and Sell DOGE Instantly on <a href="http://www.hi.exchange" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jolixo</a><br>No KYC</p></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>DOGE Price Action Analysis</strong></h2>



<p>Taking a look at the 4-hour chart, we see DOGE price stuck in a triangle pattern while the bottom part is on a trendline. The top part is located at $0.078 as the key resistance level for the price. On July 26, Dogecoin fell down to the bottom at $0.060 and found support as expected. Once again, the price bounced back and moved to the top of the triangle. With a rally, the price surpassed the SMA100 at $0.065 and reached $0.075. At that point, the selling pressure pushed the price back down.</p>



<p>Currently, the $0.063 is the first support level for DOGE and in case of good support, it can push upwards in short-term. For this scenario, Dogecoin will approach the top of the triangle at $0.078. In order to do so, it must first surpass $0.070 and $0.075 levels. After that, the $0.080, $0.085 and $0.090 are the next resistance levels.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if DOGE price fails to surpass $0.070 and subsequently loses the $0.063, we could expect further decline to follow.</p>



<p>For the bearish scenario, the $0.060 is the key support level. Further decline can bring Dogecoin below the triangle at $0.055 to $0.050 zone.</p>

<p>RSI: the relative strength index is approximately 40.</p>

<p>DOGE price failed to surpass $0.078 on July 20 and had to back down to $0.060 on July 26. With that, Dogecoin found support on the trendline and managed to stabilize. Subsequently, it had a chance for some bullish action and surpassed $0.065 on the SMA100 and reached $0.073. At that point, DOGE price faced strong resistance and is currently trading at $0.07.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><mark style="background-color:#ffffff" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">Buy and Sell DOGE Instantly on <a href="http://www.hi.exchange" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jolixo</a> [No KYC]</mark></p></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>DOGE Price Action Analysis</strong></h2>



<p>Taking a look at the 4-hour chart, we see DOGE price stuck in a triangle pattern while the bottom is located on a trendline. The top part is at $0.078 as a key resistance level for the price. On July 20<sup>th</sup>, Dogecoin reached the top part at $0.078 but failed to break through. Following that, it fell down to the bottom part at $0.060 on July 26. As expected, the buyers provided support and Dogecoin managed to bounce back moving towards the top. Once again, the price surpassed the SMA100 at $0.065 and climbed all the way up to $0.073.</p>



<p>Currently, the $0.70 to $0.065 zone is the key support level for the price. In case of successful support, we can expect Dogecoin to make another attempt to escape from the top at $0.078. With that, the $0.075 is the first resistance level followed by $0.080. After that, the $0.085 and $0.090 will be next.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if DOGE price fails to surpass $0.073 and subsequently loses the $0.065 support, further decline will follow.</p>



<p>For the bearish scenario, the $0.063 on the trendline is the key support level. Further bear action will bring Dogecoin as low as $0.050 and $0.058.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>DOGE Price Action Analysis</strong></h2>



<p>Taking a look at the 4-hour chart, we see Dogecoin making an initial bull run starting from $0.050. Following that, the price managed to surpass $0.060 and $0.070 and climb all the way up to $0.080. At this point, it had to back down with a correction.</p>



<p>Currently, the $0.065 is the first support level for Dogecoin. In case of good support, DOGE price could make another attempt to surpass $0.080. Before that, it must surpass $0.070 on the SMA100 followed by $0.075. After that, the $0.090 and $0.1 are the next resistance levels for Dogecoin.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if Dogecoin fails to surpass $0.070 and $0.075 and subsequently loses the $0.065, there could be further correction to follow.</p>



<p>With that, the $0.060 will be the next support level for Dogecoin. Further decline can bring DOGE price down to $0.055 and $0.050.</p>

<p>DOGE price set on a new rally on June 18<sup>th</sup> from the $0.050 support and surpassed $0.060. Subsequently, Dogecoin climbed all the way up to $0.070 but failed to surpass that level and had to back down. With that, the price had a correction and fell down to $0.062. Once again, it had support from the SMA100 and is currently trading at $0.068.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>DOGE Price Action Analysis</strong></h2>



<p>Taking a look at the 4-hour chart, we see DOGE price failing down to $0.050 following the two-week bear market. However, that seems to be the bottom and Dogecoin managed to recover. By surpassing $0.055 and $0.060, Dogecoin came to face the strong $0.070 resistance level.</p>



<p>Currently, the downtrend at $0.70 is the first resistance level for Dogecoin. In case of a successful break through, the $0.075 is the next resistance. Following that, the $0.80 to $0.085 will come next while the $0.1 is the key resistance level for the price. On the other hand, if DOGE price fails to surpass $0.068 to $0.070, we could expect further decline.</p>



<p>For that, the $0.060 is the first support level for the price. In case of losing this level, the $0.055 will be the next support. Further decline can bring Dogecoin down to $0.050.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>DOGE Price Action Analysis</strong></h2>



<p>Taking a look at the 4-hour chart, we see DOGE failing to surpass $0.12 on May 10<sup>th</sup> and having a plunge while Bitcoin crashed. With that, Dogecoin lost the $0.10 support level and dipped as low as $0.070. However, as the buyers started to support the price, it managed to have a small bounce back.</p>



<p>Currently, the $0.10 on the SMA100 is the key resistance level for DOGE. In case of a successful breakthrough, the $0.11 on the trendline and $0.12 on the 50% Fibonacci retracement level will be the next resistance levels for DOGE.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if DOGE price fails to surpass $0.10, it could face deeper price correction. For the bearish scenario, the $0.0.85 to $0.080 will be the first support level. In case of losing this level, Dogecoin can fall as low as $0.070.</p>
