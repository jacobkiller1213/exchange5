<p>It&#8217;s exactly what you&#8217;d expect from a European digital bank, lots of rules, lots of regulations, and a world of bureaucracy! But, making a Revolut money transfer can be easy if you know the right platform. </p>



<p>For the most part, this post is a full guide on how to send money to a Revolut account instantly without having to sign up anywhere. And believe me, a simple task of sending funds to an account will be difficult without CoinCannon. </p>



<p>It will take a few minutes, so get started now!</p>



<div class="wp-block-buttons is-content-justification-center is-layout-flex wp-container-core-buttons-is-layout-1 wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex">
<div class="wp-block-button has-custom-width wp-block-button__width-100 is-style-outline is-style-outline--1"><a class="wp-block-button__link has-black-color has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-text-color has-background has-link-color wp-element-button" href="https://hi.exchange/En?cur_from=USDTTRC20&amp;cur_to=Revolut"><strong>Transfer Money to Revolut!</strong></a></div>
</div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-revolut-and-why-would-i-need-it">What is Revolut and Why Would I Need it?</h2>



<p>This ain&#8217;t you 2010&#8217;s blog post with 4000 words ðŸ™‚ so I will just cut it down to the basics! Basically, Revolut is simply a digital bank based in the UK. They have had a massive success over the past few years as a replacement for physical banks. You can have your own virtual card from Revolut and use it for online payments or use it when you&#8217;re traveling. </p>



<p>Now, since I&#8217;m not on the Revolut marketing team (yo Revolut marketing, hit me up if you&#8217;re interested), my honest opinion about them is that it is at best a mediocre digital banking solution mostly suited for Europeans. What they have to offer is good currency exchange rates. But, there are better options out there. Nonetheless, its popularity and the free subscription (for the basic plan) means that lots of people will sign up for a revolut account and card.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-to-make-a-revolut-money-transfer">How to Make a Revolut Money Transfer?</h2>



<p>If you don&#8217;t have a Revolut account, making the transfer has to be done via another bank. In such case, you will not be able to transfer cryptocurrencies to your account. However, with CoinCannon, making the Revolut money transfer is instant and easy. Here&#8217;s how it works:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>You select Tether USDT and Revolut EUR on the exchange box</li>



<li>Send us the destination Revolut address iBAN, account holder name and email address</li>



<li>You send USDT to CoinCannon&#8217;s wallet</li>



<li>CoinCannon will send funds to the designated Revolut address</li>
</ol>



<p>By using CoinCannon, there is no need for a bank account, or signing up on any platform. The process is instant and regardless of where you live, you can still make Revolut money transfers. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-common-questions-about-revolut">Common Questions about Revolut</h2>

<p><strong>2. Does Revolut support cryptocurrency transactions?</strong></p>



<p>Yes, Revolut allows users to buy, sell, and hold cryptocurrencies, but direct withdrawals to external wallets are limited.</p>

<p>You can fund your Revolut account via bank transfer, debit/credit card, Apple Pay, Google Pay, or supported e-wallets.</p>



<p><strong>4. Can I exchange USDT to Revolut?</strong></p>
