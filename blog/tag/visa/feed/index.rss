<p>If you&#8217;re reading this blog post, it means that you need to purchase something online or register somewhere but don&#8217;t have a debit card to use. Obviously, a virtual debit card is the answer right? No! a virtual debit card is not necessarily the best solution for your needs simply because you will have to pay a lot more fees. let&#8217;s face it, there is no such thing as a free debit card. Instead, you will have have to pay a whole lot of extra fees for a virtual debit card that is a pain in the bottom area! On top of that, you have to fill out forms, wait for confirmation, give out all your personal information and worry about the card declining! </p>



<p>So what if I told you that there&#8217;s a totally better option? With zero extra fees, and it comes instantly with no sign up, how about that? </p>



<p><strong>With CoinCannon Online Payments, you can pay with 100+ currencies including crypto and e-currencies, and CoinCannon will use its own debit card to pay for you! </strong></p>



<p>By doing this, you can instantly pay for your purchase without paying any extra fees. You will have PayPal, Visa card and MasterCard payments anywhere on the vast expanse of web, anytime you need! </p>



<p>Ready to go? Click on the button below and get started!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-use-a-virtual-debit-card">Why use a virtual debit card?</h2>



<p>Depending on where you live and your life choices ðŸ™‚  you might not have a debit card! in that case, there comes a time where you need to purchase something online and they only take a handful of debit cards for payment. having a virtual debit card let&#8217;s you bypass all that regulatory shenanigan but at a cost! </p>



<p>there&#8217;s also another scenario in which you find yourself in need of a free debit card! And that&#8217;s when you&#8217;re going to register on a website or application and they ask for your card info! In such cases of presumptuous capitalist demand, do not give them what they ask for! I mean, if a presumably &#8220;free&#8221; website is asking for your debit card information, it will only mean that at some point, their customer journey is designed to bill you and take money (trust me, I&#8217;ve been in marketing for years!).</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-not-use-a-prepaid-debit-card">Why Not Use a Prepaid Debit Card?</h2>



<p>And now, you&#8217;re looking for a virtual debit card to get around the problem. But here&#8217;s a list of new problems that you&#8217;ll have:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Having to pay activation fee, purchase fee, exchange rate fee, third party markup fee!</li>



<li>A long process of purchasing your prepaid debit card</li>



<li>Sharing your personal information for a so called &#8220;free debit card&#8221;</li>



<li>Risking the purchase of a card that might not work! </li>



<li>Having to sign up on a sketchy website and believe me, they will send you promotional emails!</li>
</ul>



<p>After all, a virtual debit card is not exactly legit, is it?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-jolixo-has-to-offer">What CoinCannon has to Offer</h2>



<p>A better solution! here&#8217;s how it works:</p>



<p>You open <a href="http://www.hi.exchange/en">jolixo</a>, choose the currency you want to pay with</p>

<p>Then, select which debit card you need. we have Visa, MasterCard and PayPal. then, click on &#8220;next&#8221; to head to the second step.</p>
