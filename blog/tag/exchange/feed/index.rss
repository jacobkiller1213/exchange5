<p>What if I told you that you don&#8217;t need a credit card for online shopping? All you need is someone with a credit card to pay for you right? then, CoinCannon does the work for you!<br>At this point, you might think that you want a virtual prepaid credit card for online shopping but that&#8217;s complicated too. <strong>The alternative we offer is instant, anonymous and comes with much lower rates than a prepaid card</strong>. Here&#8217;s how it works.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>You want to buy something online that requires a credit card for online shopping.</li>



<li>You come to CoinCannon, send whatever currency you have like Tether USDT, Bitcoin or 100+ different currencies. Then you send us the link for your online shopping.</li>



<li>CoinCannon will go to the link and make the payment for you and send you the payment confirmation.</li>
</ul>



<p>Oh and by the way, it&#8217;s instant, with no KYC and comes with 24/7 support!</p>



<div class="wp-block-buttons is-content-justification-center is-layout-flex wp-container-core-buttons-is-layout-1 wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex">
<div class="wp-block-button"><a class="wp-block-button__link wp-element-button" href="https://hi.exchange/En/solutions/online-payment?cur_from=USDTTRC20&amp;cur_to=PPUSDI">Start Now!</a></div>
</div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-limitless-virtual-credit-card">The Limitless Virtual Credit Card </h2>



<p>It&#8217;s a pain in the bottom I tell ya! having to buy virtual credit card, going through all the different websites to find the best one, filling out the forms, paying all the extra money for a card you can only use once. Not to mention all the time you waste on purchasing a card for purchasing another thing on the internet! ain&#8217;t nobody got time for that! </p>



<p>Here&#8217;s what we do instead, we can be your cool friend who already has a credit card. All you gotta do is pay your buddy CoinCannon however you like and we&#8217;ll handle the payment stuff like a champ! </p>



<p>That way, you don&#8217;t have to waste time or money and the capitalism gods will be happy! </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-not-to-apply-for-an-online-credit-card-for-shopping">How not to Apply for an Online Credit Card for Shopping</h2>



<p>Honestly, purchasing a virtual credit card is a big hassle for all of us. If you live in a country where payments processors like PayPal, Visa or MasterCard do not provide services, then the trouble gets bigger! </p>



<p>But thanks to our frightening genius, your online purchases will have no limits and shall remain liberated from all the bounds of regulatory nightmare that consumes our ever-expanding financial limbo scattered around the vast expanse of the interweb! (the author has studied literature and wanted to showcase his poetic abilities with this paragraph!) </p>



<p>Whether you&#8217;re a freelancer or representing a business, having an quick and easy alternative for the expensive online credit card for shopping will give you a boost in performance. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-credit-card-fees-vs-jolixo-fees">Credit Card Fees Vs. CoinCannon Fees</h2>



<p>Here&#8217;s a quick look at the associated fees for a prepaid visa card:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Activation Fee</strong> – Typically $3 to $10.</li>



<li><strong>Purchase Fee</strong> – Some retailers charge an extra fee, usually around $5 to $15.</li>



<li><strong>Exchange Rate Fees</strong> – If you&#8217;re buying it with crypto or a foreign currency, you might pay an extra 1-5%.</li>



<li><strong>Third-Party Markup</strong> – If you’re buying from a reseller, they may charge an additional percentage.</li>
</ol>



<p>If you’re buying from an official provider like Vanilla Visa or a bank, you might just pay the face value ($1,000) plus a small fee. If you&#8217;re getting it from a crypto exchange or P2P seller, expect to pay more, sometimes up to <strong>5-15% extra</strong>.</p>



<p>Considering the fees mentioned above, when utilizing CoinCannon, you will ONLY pay a 1% to 5% exchange fee and there will be <strong>no extra charge at all</strong>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-do-i-need-to-purchase-a-prepaid-card">What do I Need to Purchase a Prepaid Card?</h2>



<p>When purchasing a credit card for online shopping, you will have to sign up on the retailer&#8217;s website and disclose lots and lots of your personal information. mind you, the process can take days! As mentioned before, there are many countries in which online credit cards or even prepaid cards do not provide services. Other than that, paying for the credit card does also require a specific currency. In that regard, you might have to exchange what you already have beforehand and pay for yet another exchange fee.</p>



<p>By using CoinCannon, you will not share any personal information and basically do not need anything to make the purchase. CoinCannon supports 100+ currencies for payment and will instantly make your purchase. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-24-7-online-support">24/7 Online Support</h2>



<p>In order to make sure everything goes as planned, CoinCannon provides online support available all day, everyday. So get started now and Enjoy Online Payments like never before!</p>

<p>If you’re looking to exchange Ethereum to DAI, <a href="http://www.hi.exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jolixo</a> is all you need! Volatile assets such as ETH and BTC will definitely have some risks associated with them. However, investors can easily convert them into stablecoins to stop the loss at a certain period of time. Thankfully, exchanging crypto assets into one another does not have massive fees so it’s a pretty safe bet. As far as stablecoins go, DAI has been a top choice for crypto enthusiasts as it is perhaps very different than the others. In this article, we will go over everything you need to know on how to exchange Ethereum to DAI on CoinCannon platform.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Learn <a href="https://hi.exchange/blog/exchange-cryptocurrency-to-paypal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How to Exchange Cryptocurrency to PayPal</a></p></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What Do I Need to Exchange Ethereum to DAI?</strong></h2>



<p>For this exchange, you will need a crypto wallet to receive DAI. In case your Ether wallet supports DAI, you can also receive funds in the same wallet. Make sure that you are using a reliable crypto wallet to hold your assets. On the other hand, for CoinCannon platform, all you need is an email address. CoinCannon does not require KYC (know your customer) or sign up. However, there are benefits and rewards for those who <a href="https://blog.hi.exchange/reasosn-sign-up-jolixo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sign up on CoinCannon</a>. How do you like winning $100 gifts ever single month?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is Ethereum?</strong></h2>



<p>As an open-source decentralized blockchain platform, Ethereum is perhaps the most diverse and innovative one out there. In its essence, it is a decentralized public ledger for verifying and recording transactions. The Ethereum is considered as a second-gen blockchain platform, improving upon the high gas fees, scalability issues and high transactions fees of previous platforms. This open-source platform has no geographical restrictions and has always been the tip of the spear as far as innovation goes. Essential services such as Smart contracts, NFT`s and decentralized apps were first introduced on the Ethereum platform. As for the cherry on top, the native token of the Ethereum platform called Ether or ETH is second in terms of market value standing only behind Bitcoin.</p>



<p>With the <a href="https://blog.hi.exchange/ethereum-2-0-upgrade-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethereum 2.0</a> launch in August 2022, the network totally switched to proof of stake. With that, Ethereum network will have much better scalability and very low gas fees. On top of that, all the criticism regarding energy consumption will go away. Many consider the 2.0 upgrade as a great investment opportunity since ETH is very much likely to have a rally. Nonetheless, Ethereum is the second most popular cryptocurrency in the world for good reason. Their team has always been on the forefront of innovation which could potentially attract capital and provide great returns.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why Exchange Ethereum to DAI?</strong></h2>



<p>DAI is an Ethereum-based stablecoin. A stablecoin is a cryptocurrency with a pegged value to another currency. In case of DAI, it is pegged to the US dollar and much like Tether and USDC, Dai will always be worth $1. Stablecoins are a crucial part of the crypto market as they offer very little volatility. In that regard, investors use stablecoins to save their funds in the form of a reliable and stable asset.</p>



<p>What makes DAI unique is a clever design that eliminates the biggest concerns for stablecoins. Generally speaking, conventional stablecoins require a massive reserve by the company. For example, for every Tether USD, the Tether company must hold $1 USD in their reserve. This is a huge issue for companies as it is difficult to provide liquidity and keep it consistent.</p>



<p>DAI offers a new solution for this problem. By using an automated system of smart contracts on Ethereum blockchain, DAI does now need a reserve. Using collateralized debt denominated in ETH allows DAI to maintain the 1:1 ration with USD. Simply speaking, users can deposit Ethereum or other cryptocurrencies can borrow against the value of their deposit and generate new DAI. The currency is this case is known as collateral.</p>



<p>Currently, DAI has a market cap of over $5 billion and is ranked as 17th cryptocurrency.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for WMZ, you can instantly exchange Tether to Webmoney on <a href="http://www.hi.exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jolixo</a>. Webmoney is an online system based in Russia and is a favorite among Forex traders. The transactions are quick and cheap. Furthermore, numerous online merchants accept WMZ for online purchases. In this article, we will go over how to exchange Webmoney to Tether on CoinCannon with full anonymity.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><mark style="background-color:#ffffff" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">Learn How to <a href="https://blog.hi.exchange/how-exchange-webmoney-to-paypal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Exchange Webmoney to PayPal</a></mark></p></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What Do I Need to Exchange Tether to Webmoney?</strong></h2>



<p>For this exchange direction, you will need a Webmoney account and a crypto wallet. Make sure that your WMZ account is verified in order to receive the deposit. Bear in mind that CoinCannon platform does not require KYC or sign up but there are many benefits for those who <a href="https://blog.hi.exchange/reasosn-sign-up-jolixo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sign up on CoinCannon</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is Webmoney WMZ?</strong></h2>



<p>WebMoney is an online payment system and a comprehensive tool for online business operations. It was originally developed as a money transfer system for US dollars in Russia in 1998 and since then, nearly 40 million people from all over the globe have joined the program.</p>



<p>WebMoney provides digital currency purses that can hold popular national currencies. The payment platform provides a P2P credit purse, global payment solutions, retail services, local payment products, online billing, and direct integration with other global financial service providers. On top of that, a number of countries worldwide are currently working on WebMoney and consumers pay WebMoney for the services of different companies from Spain, Poland, and Belgium.</p>



<p>Continue reading “<a href="https://blog.hi.exchange/what-is-webmoney/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">What is Webmoney</a>”.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is Tether Used for?</strong></h2>



<p>To answer this question, we must first talk about what Tether is. To put it simply, Tether is a stablecoin. The term stablecoin refers to the stable value of the currency. To make that happen, the value of a stablecoin like Tether is pegged to a fiat currency which it represents. In case of Tether, it is pegged to US dollar. For every 1 Tether that is out there, there is $1 USD held by the company.</p>



<p>This stable value gives investors the opportunity to benefit from a blockchain based coin that does not fluctuate in value.</p>



<p>Furthermore, Tether simultaneously operates on two blockchains. ERC20 which is on Ethereum network and TRC20 that is on Tron network. Generally speaking, TRC20 Tether is much faster in transactions and maintains much lower transaction fees. We recommend you to use TRC20 as much as possible due to better performance.</p>

<p>Every exchange platform must maintain three important characteristics. Anonymity, affordability and reliability. We pride ourselves as a professional platform that offers all three.</p>

<p>As of October 2022, Ethereum is one of the hottest cryptocurrencies. If you are looking for a platform to exchange Ethereum to Perfect Money and not compromise on anything, you are in luck. </p>



<p><a href="http://www.hi.exchange" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jolixo</a> platform is the best place to exchange cryptocurrencies with multiple advantages which we will go over later in this article. In the meantime, Perfect Money users may not find it easy to find platforms who support them. </p>



<p>Thankfully, CoinCannon is an official Perfect Money partner that is also verified. In this article, we will go over everything you need to know to exchange Ethereum to PM.</p>



<div class="wp-block-buttons is-content-justification-center is-layout-flex wp-container-core-buttons-is-layout-2 wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex">

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-should-i-exchange-ethereum-to-pm"><strong>Should I Exchange Ethereum to PM?</strong></h2>

<p>You can use PM to:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Transference of money between users</li>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-jolixo-platform"><strong>CoinCannon Platform</strong></h2>



<p>To exchange any cryptocurrency, you will need to find a good platform first. However, despite the diversity, it is quite a difficult task to find a good online exchange. The problem begins by compromising on your standards. You will want good exchange rates, privacy and reliability altogether. And that is hard to find!</p>



<p>Harsh regulations are pushing exchanges to disclose customer data to governments. This goes against the initial purpose of crypto which is absolute anonymity. Even worse, user data is a commodity, large institutions buy your information at a certain price. The best way to make sure your data is safe, is to not share them at all.</p>



<p>However, it is a luxury to offer no KYC, hence many exchanges charge customers with ridiculous exchange rates to compensate for the anonymity.</p>



<p><a href="https://hi.exchange/">jolixo</a> on the other hand gives you everything all at once. Want privacy? We have no KYC. Want the best exchange rates? Well, simply visit Bestchange or OkChanger and see for yourself how we are always on top of their lists.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is Perfect Money?</strong></h2>



<p>Perfect Money is an e-currency used for making payments on the internet. It is widely accepted as payment option by countless platforms. With Perfect Money, you can do a lot! Be it transferring funds to others or pay for goods and services. Or how about buying cryptocurrencies or even buying fiat currencies. It is a seriously popular payment method for online users. An additional capability is to loan and receipt issuance throughout the system.</p>



<p>The biggest downside of Perfect Money, however, is that you cannot cash Perfect money to your bank account on its website directly. For that, <strong>you will need a platform like CoinCannon to exchange your Perfect Money to PayPal and other e-currencies</strong>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is Tether used for?</strong></h2>



<p>To answer this question, we must first talk about what Tether is. To put it simply, Tether is a stablecoin. The term stablecoin refers to the stable value of the currency. To make that happen, the value of a stablecoin like Tether is pegged to a fiat currency which it represents. In case of Tether, it is pegged to US dollar. For every 1 Tether that is out there, there is $1 USD held by the company.</p>



<p>This stable value gives investors the opportunity to benefit from a blockchain based coin that does not fluctuate in value.</p>



<p>Furthermore, Tether simultaneously operates on two blockchains. ERC20 which is on Ethereum network and TRC20 that is on Tron network. Generally speaking, TRC20 Tether is much faster in transactions and maintains much lower transaction fees. We recommend you to use TRC20 as much as possible due to better performance.</p>
