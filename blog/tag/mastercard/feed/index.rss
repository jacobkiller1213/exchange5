<p>If you&#8217;re reading this blog post, it means that you need to purchase something online or register somewhere but don&#8217;t have a debit card to use. Obviously, a virtual debit card is the answer right? No! a virtual debit card is not necessarily the best solution for your needs simply because you will have to pay a lot more fees. let&#8217;s face it, there is no such thing as a free debit card. Instead, you will have have to pay a whole lot of extra fees for a virtual debit card that is a pain in the bottom area! On top of that, you have to fill out forms, wait for confirmation, give out all your personal information and worry about the card declining! </p>



<p>So what if I told you that there&#8217;s a totally better option? With zero extra fees, and it comes instantly with no sign up, how about that? </p>



<p><strong>With CoinCannon Online Payments, you can pay with 100+ currencies including crypto and e-currencies, and CoinCannon will use its own debit card to pay for you! </strong></p>



<p>By doing this, you can instantly pay for your purchase without paying any extra fees. You will have PayPal, Visa card and MasterCard payments anywhere on the vast expanse of web, anytime you need! </p>



<p>Ready to go? Click on the button below and get started!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-use-a-virtual-debit-card">Why use a virtual debit card?</h2>



<p>Depending on where you live and your life choices 🙂  you might not have a debit card! in that case, there comes a time where you need to purchase something online and they only take a handful of debit cards for payment. having a virtual debit card let&#8217;s you bypass all that regulatory shenanigan but at a cost! </p>



<p>there&#8217;s also another scenario in which you find yourself in need of a free debit card! And that&#8217;s when you&#8217;re going to register on a website or application and they ask for your card info! In such cases of presumptuous capitalist demand, do not give them what they ask for! I mean, if a presumably &#8220;free&#8221; website is asking for your debit card information, it will only mean that at some point, their customer journey is designed to bill you and take money (trust me, I&#8217;ve been in marketing for years!).</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-not-use-a-prepaid-debit-card">Why Not Use a Prepaid Debit Card?</h2>



<p>And now, you&#8217;re looking for a virtual debit card to get around the problem. But here&#8217;s a list of new problems that you&#8217;ll have:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Having to pay activation fee, purchase fee, exchange rate fee, third party markup fee!</li>



<li>A long process of purchasing your prepaid debit card</li>



<li>Sharing your personal information for a so called &#8220;free debit card&#8221;</li>



<li>Risking the purchase of a card that might not work! </li>



<li>Having to sign up on a sketchy website and believe me, they will send you promotional emails!</li>
</ul>



<p>After all, a virtual debit card is not exactly legit, is it?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-jolixo-has-to-offer">What CoinCannon has to Offer</h2>



<p>A better solution! here&#8217;s how it works:</p>



<p>You open <a href="http://www.hi.exchange/en">jolixo</a>, choose the currency you want to pay with</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-2 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="1024" height="275" data-id="8721" src="https://hi.exchange/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/virtual-debit-card-Free-Debit-Card-step-1-1024x275.png" alt="virtual debit card - free debit card " class="wp-image-8721" srcset="https://hi.exchange/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/virtual-debit-card-Free-Debit-Card-step-1-1024x275.png 1024w, https://hi.exchange/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/virtual-debit-card-Free-Debit-Card-step-1-300x81.png 300w, https://hi.exchange/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/virtual-debit-card-Free-Debit-Card-step-1-768x206.png 768w, https://hi.exchange/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/virtual-debit-card-Free-Debit-Card-step-1-1536x413.png 1536w, https://hi.exchange/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/virtual-debit-card-Free-Debit-Card-step-1.png 1895w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>
</figure>



<p>Then, select which debit card you need. we have Visa, MasterCard and PayPal. then, click on &#8220;next&#8221; to head to the second step.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img decoding="async" width="956" height="654" src="https://hi.exchange/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Virtual-debit-card-free-dibit-card-step-2.png" alt="virtual debit card - free debit card " class="wp-image-8722" srcset="https://hi.exchange/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Virtual-debit-card-free-dibit-card-step-2.png 956w, https://hi.exchange/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Virtual-debit-card-free-dibit-card-step-2-300x205.png 300w, https://hi.exchange/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Virtual-debit-card-free-dibit-card-step-2-768x525.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 956px) 100vw, 956px" /></figure></div>


<p>On the second step, share the purchase link, username and password for the account + any additional info. CoinCannon will automatically delete your account information after your transaction is done. However, make sure to change your password later.</p>



<p>click on &#8220;next&#8221; one more time to head to the third step. Here, you get a final chance to review your order. </p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img decoding="async" width="600" height="792" src="https://hi.exchange/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/virtual-debit-card-free-debit-card-step-3.png" alt="virtual debit card - free debit card " class="wp-image-8723" srcset="https://hi.exchange/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/virtual-debit-card-free-debit-card-step-3.png 600w, https://hi.exchange/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/virtual-debit-card-free-debit-card-step-3-227x300.png 227w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></figure></div>

<p>In today’s interconnected world, online payments are the heart of global commerce. However, for many users in countries like Russia, Iran, Venezuela, and Cuba, accessing trusted international payment gateways such as PayPal, Visa, and MasterCard remains a significant challenge. These obstacles, often caused by laws, currency restrictions, or regional rules, leave individuals and businesses struggling to complete essential online transactions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Recognizing these difficulties, CoinCannon offers an innovative solution: <a href="https://hi.exchange/En/solutions/online-payment">Online Payment</a>, a service that allows users to avoid traditional barriers and complete payments quickly, securely, and without the need for challenging account setups or verifications.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-nbsp-what-is-online-payment-nbsp-nbsp">&nbsp;What Is Online Payment?&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Online payment refers to the process of transferring money digitally to pay for goods, services, or subscriptions. From PayPal and Visa to cryptocurrencies and Perfect Money, online payment methods&nbsp; respond&nbsp; to different needs like:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Visa and MasterCard:</strong> Ideal for global shoppers, travelers, and businesses.  </li>



<li><strong>PayPal: </strong>A popular choice for freelancers and gamers due to its versatility.  </li>



<li><strong>Cryptocurrencies: </strong>Favored by privacy-focused users and tech-savvy individuals.  </li>



<li><strong>Perfect Money:</strong> Frequently used in hosting, VPS services, and entertainment platforms.  </li>
</ul>



<p>While these payment methods are powerful, accessing and managing them can be difficult—especially in restricted regions. This is where CoinCannon comes in.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-nbsp-how-does-jolixo-online-payment-work-nbsp-nbsp">&nbsp;How Does CoinCannon Online Payment Work?&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>



<p>CoinCannon simplified online payments with its shortcut service, enabling users to make payments using cryptocurrencies while CoinCannon takes care of the rest.</p>



<p>This means users no longer need to have an existing account or go through the effort of creating a new one, funding it (and paying transaction fees in the process!), and then finally making their payment. CoinCannon Online Payment simplifies this challenging process, saving both time and effort. Here’s how it works:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-step-1-you-can-pay-with-cryptocurrency-nbsp"><strong>Step 1: You Can Pay with Cryptocurrency</strong>&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Begin by selecting your preferred cryptocurrency, There is a wide variety of cryptocurrencies you can choose.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-step-2-choose-the-payment-method"><strong>Step 2: Choose the Payment Method</strong></h3>



<p>Select your preferred payment method, such as Visa Card, MasterCard, or PayPal. Once you’ve made your choice, provide us with the necessary link and details of your order, and we’ll take care of the payment for you.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-step-3-jolixo-converts-the-payment"><strong>Step 3: CoinCannon Converts the Payment</strong></h3>



<p>The platform processes the payment and converts it into the required format.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-step-4-payment-is-completed-via-preferred-method"><strong>Step 4: Payment Is Completed via Preferred Method</strong></h3>



<p>&nbsp;CoinCannon delivers the payment using Visa, MasterCard or PayPal —no account setup required.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This simple procedure removes all barriers, making online payments possible to everyone, no matter their location or restrictions.</p>

<p>The race to provide crypto services is on! Yesterday, we reported on Cash App unveiling three crypto services and today, similar news has turned up for Mastercard. Payment giants are now openly embracing crypto with open arms and seem to have gotten over their hesitance. This time, the global payment titan Mastercard has filled 15 new trademark applications all related to crypto services including fintech and metaverse technologies. Although the initial debut might take some time, here’s a good rumor you can buy and sell it while the news gets out.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote has-vivid-cyan-blue-color has-text-color" style="font-style:normal;font-weight:200"><blockquote><p>Buy Bitcoin Instantly on <a href="http://www.hi.exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jolixo</a> <br>No KYC</p></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Crypto Services on Mastercard</strong></h2>



<p>Let’s face it, we will all live and breathe in metaverse in the years to come. Even if that may not be true, Mastercard is totally not going to miss out on payment services inside the virtual world of our promising future. Hence, the 15 trademark applications all indicate Mastercard is onboard the NFT- Metaverse train.</p>



<p>According to top trademark lawyer Mike Kondoudis, the recent request is indicative of plans to create NFT-backed media as well as a payment processing and e-commerce transaction system in the metaverse. And since that is not done to death, a marketplace for crypto assets seems to be on the way.</p>



<p>The crypto services include trademarks for downloadable multimedia files containing video, text, artwork and audio verified by NFTs and e-commerce software. The software at hand will operate within the metaverse to handle electronic business transactions.</p>



<p>But fear not, there will be virtual credit cards and debit cards in the metaverse for you to over-spend with. Master card will process payments using these cards in metaverse.</p>

</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What Happens in Metaverse…</strong></h2>



<p>According to Kondoudis, Mastercard has also filed trademarks for events and performances in the metaverse. Furthermore, they have applied to create online communities related to digital assets.</p>



<p>Interestingly, Kondoudis has also found the number of NFT trademarks to be skyrocketing as compare with last year. In fact, the trademarks so far (Q1, 2022) have surpassed the total number of last year. As of April 2022, about 1,967 applications have been submitted while the total number for 2021 has been 1,965.</p>



<p>Mastercard revealed plans this year to create an NFT marketplace in association with exchange platform Coinbase. The marketplace will go live sometime in the future and will support Mastercard debit and credit cards for payments.</p>

<p>Mastercard, the payment giant has announced a partnership with Bakkt, a crypto services company. The joint project is expected to expand crypto accessibility for both customers and merchants.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Mastercard and Bakkt</strong></h2>



<p>The <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211025005487/en/Mastercard-and-Bakkt-Partner-to-Offer-Innovative-Crypto-and-Loyalty-Solutions">announcement</a> made on October 25, had a promise of quick and easy access to cryptocurrency services.</p>



<p>According to the statements, “Mastercard customers can now enable consumers to buy, sell and hold cryptocurrency, deliver unique, crypto-centric loyalty opportunities, and streamline issuance of branded crypto debit and credit cards”.</p>



<p>Bakkt is a digital asset platform that provides both services and solutions for customers. The integration of services in Mastercard ecosystem will be beneficial for both parties.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bullish on Bakkt</strong></h2>



<p>Following the news, BKKT, had an incredible 240% rally in only five days. A testament to the open arms of the public to crypto adoption.</p>



<p>The company was found in 2018 by Gavin Michael, a prominent crypto personality. As a previous Coinbase investor and a New York Stock Exchange owner, Michael is as seasoned as a CEO can get.</p>



<p>“We’re lowering the barriers to entry, allowing people to take something like your rewards points and trade them into crypto. It’s an easy way to get going because you’re not using cash, you’re putting something that’s an idle asset sitting on your balance sheet, and we’re allowing you to put in to work.” Said Bakkt in an interview with <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/25/mastercard-says-any-bank-or-merchant-on-its-vast-network-can-soon-offer-crypto-services.html">CNBC</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Mastercard Joins the Race</strong></h2>



<p>It seems that the cryptocurrency adoption is picking up pace. Considering the warnings of hyperinflation and the institutions hedging against it with <a href="https://blog.hi.exchange/as-inflation-grows-institutions-buy-bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a>, it is a first come first serve situation.</p>



<p>Large companies are now inclined to join the race of crypto adoption since the market favors those who came first. Although a bit unrelated, <a href="https://blog.hi.exchange/bitcoin-atm-machines-now-on-walmart/">Walmart</a> installing Bitcoin ATMs is another example of this phenomenon. Furthermore, the <a href="https://blog.hi.exchange/another-bitcoin-etf-set-to-roll-out-in-us/">Bitcoin ETF rollout</a> in the US stock exchange was another example of the huge capacity and appeal for crypto investment.</p>



<p>We are at a critical point in history when giants are racing to invest in cryptocurrencies. In that regard, the market has an extremely bullish outlook.</p>



<p>Mastercard states that the crypto loyalty programs will be more efficient for both merchants and customers.</p>



<p>“[We are] enabling… partners to offer cryptocurrency as rewards and create fungibility between loyalty points and other digital assets. This means that consumers can earn and spend rewards in cryptocurrency instead of traditional loyalty points and seamlessly convert their crypto holdings to pay for purchases.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>jolixo</strong></h2>



<p><a href="http://hi.exchange">jolixo</a> is a decentralized online platform to exchange your cryptocurrencies and e-currencies. We utilize an automated system to determine the best exchange rates at any moment. Furthermore, CoinCannon does not require KYC or a sign-up process.
