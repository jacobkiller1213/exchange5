<p>If you’re looking to know how to buy Polkadot with Perfect Money look no further as we will provide a full 2024 guide and the best platform to make the exchange. </p>



<p>DOT has been amongst the very best altcoins in the past two years. Utilizing a revolutionary idea as well as great leadership by Gavin Wood, the network is reaching new heights. </p>



<p>In this article, we will guide you on how to buy Polkadot with Perfect Money and to avoid sky-high exchange rates. Furthermore, you don’t have to share your personal information with the platform unlike big trading apps.</p>



<p>Get started right now, head over to <a href="http://www.hi.exchange/">jolixo</a> to buy DOT.</p>



<div class="wp-block-buttons is-content-justification-center is-layout-flex wp-container-core-buttons-is-layout-1 wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex">
<div class="wp-block-button is-style-outline is-style-outline--1"><a class="wp-block-button__link has-black-color has-text-color has-background has-link-color wp-element-button" href="http://www.hi.exchange/" style="background-color:#f49d3f">Buy <strong>DOT</strong> with <strong>Perfect Money</strong> Right Now!</a></div>
</div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-buy-polkadot-with-perfect-money"><strong>Why Buy Polkadot with Perfect Money?</strong></h2>



<p>Perfect Money is an e-currency used for making payments on the internet. It is widely accepted as payment option by countless platforms. With Perfect Money, you can do a lot! Be it transferring funds to others or pay for goods and services. Or how about buying cryptocurrencies or even buying fiat currencies. It is a seriously popular payment method for online users. An additional capability is to loan and receipt issuance throughout the system.</p>



<p>The biggest downside of Perfect Money, however, is that you cannot cash Perfect money to your bank account on its website directly. For that, you will need a platform like CoinCannon to exchange your Perfect Money to PayPal and other e-currencies.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-to-buy-polkadot-with-perfect-money"><strong>How to Buy Polkadot with Perfect Money?</strong></h2>



<p>Here are the five easy steps to make the purchase:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Step 1 : </strong>Enter the homepage first, then select Perfect Money and Polkadot from the options in the first step. Enter the amount you want to exchange. Following that, the amount of DOT you will receive will automatically calculate.</li>



<li><strong>Step 2 : </strong>Press Exchange and you will go to the next stage where you will enter your Polkadot wallet details, email, and phone number.</li>



<li><strong>Step 3 : </strong>One more time, click on the “Exchange” button and you will go to the next step where you will review your order.</li>



<li><strong>Step 4 : </strong>Complete the captcha and click on exchange to go to the next step where you will obtain a tracking ID. Press the “Pay Order” button to go to the Perfect Money gateway and make the payment to our Perfect Money account. Having transferred your Perfect Money to CoinCannon, your order will process very quickly.</li>



<li><strong>Step 5 : </strong>By finishing all the steps above, our team of professionals will send the Polkadot to your wallet ASAP.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-that-was-easy"><strong>That Was Easy!</strong></h2>



<p>The sales team will immediately process the exchange and make the DOT payment to your wallet. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-to-choose-jolixo"><strong>Why to choose CoinCannon?</strong></h2>



<p><a href="http://www.hi.exchange/">jolixo</a> was found with the vision to create a solid exchange platform that offers everything the customers need. And the platform successfully dealt with all the challenges. Ideally speaking, an online exchange must offer privacy, efficiency and reliability altogether.</p>



<p>Cryptocurrencies are losing the anonymity as more and more institutions continue to sell user data to both regulators and the highest bidders. To prevent your data from getting in the wrong hands, the best method is to not share it with unnecessary platforms. In that regard, CoinCannon platform respects customer privacy by not asking for it at all. No KYC or sign up is mandatory on the website.</p>



<p>Protecting your privacy on the other hand is not a luxury. In that regard, it is not easy to find an exchange that offers both privacy and low exchange rates simultaneously. However, CoinCannon has managed to offer both at the same time. The exchange rates are competitive as you can see for yourself on ranking websites such as BestChange and OkChanger.</p>



<p>Last but not least, reliability is a proof of work that comes with experience. The platform offers 24/7 customer support to ensure all potential problems are immediately dealt with.</p>

Thankfully, there are many reasons to invest in Polkadot (DOT) as it is one of the best long-term investments in the crypto sector. The internet of blockchains is connected to multiple different blockchains using various technologies. In that regard, Polkadot has always been the top of the spear when it comes to innovation. But, considering the intensity of the energy crisis we are facing today, Polkadot has a competitive edge that others don’t have.

With that, the network will surely stand the test of upcoming regulations concerned with energy consumption. Fortunately, you can buy Polkadot with Payeer on CoinCannon with no added fees in only a matter of minutes.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What Do I Need to Buy Polkadot with Payeer?</strong></h2>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is Polkadot?</strong></h2>



<p>And here we have yet another third generation blockchain network found by a previous Ethereum member. Initially, Gavin James Wood had a different vision in mind about the (PoS) algorithm. The final goal is to create an infrastructure to create a network of blockchains that are effortlessly communicating with each other.</p>



<p>The multiple blockchain approach provides a better cross-chain interoperability and easier communication. Gavin believes that a single blockchain network can never be complete and a multi-chain architecture will be much more efficient.</p>



<p>The DOT is the token for this multi-chain network. It is currently number 9 by market cap. With the first ICO in 2017, it managed to raise $145 million. Despite being relatively new, it has experienced a huge growth in popularity. DOT has had one of the most successful initial coin offerings in history, raising over 200 million in two ICOs, first one in 2017 and the other in 2020.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why Use Payeer?</strong></h2>



<p>First and foremost, Payeer is considered an online digital wallet for better asset management. Be it crypto of fiat, the payment processor is quick, reliable and cheap. In that regard, in a short lifespan of almost 8 years, Payeer is now recognized as one of the very best amongst</p>



<p>competitors. Payeer utilizes built-in payment services with giant financial services such as Mastercard, VISA and PayPal.</p>



<p>As of 2022, the Payeer has approximately 7 million users which can transfer funds to each other with extremely low fees. The strength however, lies in diversity. Payeer is far ahead of any similar platform in terms of scale of operation and diversity in supported payment methods. With more than 50 payment approaches, the Payeer wallet offers users various services in one place.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>CoinCannon Platform</strong></h2>



<p>CoinCannon is an online exchange platform that offers three critical factors for customers. Privacy, Efficiency and Reliability are not an easy combination to find on the internet.</p>



<p>For privacy, the ultimate way to protect your personal information is to not disclose them at all. Unfortunately, a vast majority exchanges are now legally obliged to hand over user data to governments for tax purposes. CoinCannon does not require customers to go through KYC or a sign up process as a sign of respect for anonymity.</p>



<p>Efficiency for an exchange platform calls for competitive exchange rates and quick processing time for orders. To maximize results and minimize efforts, the platform utilizes an automated consensus algorithm to determine the best exchange rates.</p>

<p>Polkadot (DOT) clearly knows one or two things about the future of blockchain. In a world when a huge energy crisis is terrifyingly the governments, it’s time to put catalytic convertors on mining rigs. Arguably, a storm of regulatory actions is about to hit gas guzzling cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. With that, the leading altcoin by market cap is moving on to Proof of Stake mostly out of necessity. Considering the scale of Ethereum and its energy consumption, they simply can’t risk getting hurt by any new laws that will potentially limit their activities. Now, While Vitalik and his team are days away from the <a href="https://blog.hi.exchange/ethereum-2-0-upgrade-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethereum merge</a>, they will have to pull a miracle to stay relevant. In the meantime, Polkadot (DOT) has remained the most <a href="https://blog.hi.exchange/top-energy-efficient-blockhains/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">energy efficient blockchain</a>. Once again, proving that blockchain does not necessarily need to brutally consume our electricity to make the whales rich!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><mark style="background-color:#ffffff" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color"><a href="https://blog.hi.exchange/exchange-cryptocurrency-to-paypal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Exchange Cryptocurrency to PayPal</a> on CoinCannon</mark></p></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Get Ready for Winter</strong></h2>



<p>But Satoshi isn’t ready for winter. In fact, the best part about Nakamoto is all the conspiracy theories about him. With him gone, Bitcoin is left in the hands of modern day philosophers like <a href="https://blog.hi.exchange/michael-saylor-steps-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Michael Saylor</a> who pathetically lost $1 billion and respectfully lost his CEO position in MicroStrategy. Another Bitcoin proponent is Jack Dorsey who is busy with Elon’s lawsuit and the great disaster of Twitter bots. To be honest, Bitcoin maximalists have no charismatic leader and of course no tendency to show flexibility. And perhaps, flexibility is all that gets crypto through these times of crisis.</p>



<p>Speaking of crisis, there’s a big one on the horizon as the European union is bracing for a heck ton of cold showers. Once laughing out loud at warnings of their overdependence to Russian gas, EU leaders are now facing the biggest energy shortage in the history of modern Europe. Talk about shooting yourself in the foot! With extreme measures to cut energy consumption, it’s hard to imagine EU letting BTC miners operate. But, the energy shortage and drought is happening all over the world. While this may be speculation, there is overwhelming amount of evidence signaling rocky roads ahead. A winter, to be exact. And in this period where politicians are promising swift action, he who is efficient, shall be pumping and smiling.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Polkadot (DOT)</strong></h2>



<p>Once again, Polkadot (DOT) network has come out on top as the greenest blockchain. This will surely please her majesty Greta Thunberg who knows everything about everything. Sarcasm aside, Polkadot has done an impressive job staying ahead of the curve.</p>



<p>According to new research by <a href="https://twitter.com/PolkadotInsider" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Polkadot Insider</a>, the DOT network consumes only 0.1 GWH. To put that in perspective, this is roughly about six US households on average. Impressively, this low fuel consumption is also accompanied by great scalability. In fact, the Tezos network consumes the same amount of energy but lags behind in scalability.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://blog.hi.exchange/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Polkadot-DOT-1024x576.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-5935" srcset="https://hi.exchange/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Polkadot-DOT-1024x576.jpeg 1024w, https://hi.exchange/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Polkadot-DOT-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://hi.exchange/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Polkadot-DOT-768x432.jpeg 768w, https://hi.exchange/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Polkadot-DOT-1536x864.jpeg 1536w, https://hi.exchange/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Polkadot-DOT.jpeg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>As for other networks, Algorand takes the third spot with 0.5 GWH while Cardano and Avalanche are next. At the moment, Bitcoin still remains as the tree killing, bird murdering diesel sipping king of all pollution with 89000 GWH consumption. And Ethereum, is supposed to reinvent itself by the end of September. We will keep you updated on how that goes.</p>

<p>Currently, Bitcoin is trading around $39,000 which means for your investment to double, the market cap has to increase by hundreds of billions. Obviously, altcoins are not this way. But, it&#8217;s really not easy to choose the right altcoin. In this article, we will go over the the top 5 altcoins to buy in 2022. Primarily, these top 5 altcoins are chosen for the long haul hence the low-risk nature. </p>



<p>Ask any crypto skeptic about their greatest concerns over the market and they will surely tell you the primary reason for their cynical view is simply the volatility. The meme wars on twitter and the absolute swarm of shitcoins in the market is also not helping. In a decentralized and low-regulated market, Investors need to feel safe about their investments. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What Distinguishes the Top 5 Altcoins?</strong></h2>



<p>To begin with, an investor must look for the chief premise behind the cryptocurrency to invest in. There are questions to ask and certain information gaps to fill. In that case, we should look for certain qualities such as the infrastructure, the platform, the function and the possible progress in the future. Fortunately, the top 5 altcoins we are going to introduce are well-known for providing solid platforms with revolutionary technological inventions. Despite moving in different directions, all of them are highly progressive, especially when it comes to adoption of new technology. According to numerous analysts, these 5 altcoins are safe bets for the future:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><a href="http://ethereum.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethereum</a></strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="840" height="400" src="https://blog.hi.exchange/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image.jpg" alt="Ethereum - top 5 altcoins
" class="wp-image-3436" srcset="https://hi.exchange/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image.jpg 840w, https://hi.exchange/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image-300x143.jpg 300w, https://hi.exchange/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image-768x366.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px" /></figure>



<p>Long and short of it, Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain platform. It is essentially a decentralized public ledger for verifying and recording transactions. However, it is considered as one of the largest and most diverse networks out there. </p>



<p>The open-source platform provides a plethora of services to millions of people without geographical restrictions. On the platform, users can create or share services such as business, financial or even entertainment. Therefore, we have an ecosystem where users can pay fees in form of crypto to use the services.</p>



<p>The native cryptocurrency of the platform is Ether (ETH). In terms of market value, it is second, standing only behind Bitcoin. ETH was a revolutionary currency since it managed to compensate for many of Bitcoin`s shortcomings. Problems such as, high gas fees, scalability and even the high transaction fees. However, day by day we see the Ethereum platform utilize revolutionary methods to make the ecosystem even more efficient. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Considering the progressive outlook and the impressive background, investing on ETH can be considered as a safe bet for the future.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><a href="http://cardano.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ADA</a></strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="840" height="400" src="https://blog.hi.exchange/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/cardano-2.jpg" alt="ADA - Cardano - top 5 altcoins" class="wp-image-3437" srcset="https://hi.exchange/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/cardano-2.jpg 840w, https://hi.exchange/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/cardano-2-300x143.jpg 300w, https://hi.exchange/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/cardano-2-768x366.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px" /></figure>



<p>And here we have a crowd favorite! The third generation of the blockchain platform that has a cult following. It was Founded by Charles Hoskinson, one of the main creators of Ethereum. The Cardano project not only was more efficient than the previous ones, it revolutionized the blockchain technology. The Cardano project is one of the leading pioneers of the proof of stake algorithm. As compared with the proof of work, it is vastly more efficient and eco-friendly. You can read a more extensive introduction in <a href="https://blog.hi.exchange/what-is-ada-a-guide-to-the-cardano-project/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">What is ADA</a>.</p>



<p>ADA, the native token of the Cardano platform is currently the number 5 cryptocurrency by market cap. In terms of investments, as of August 3, 2021, there is more than $31 billion in the stake pools. A staggering number that is almost double of what ETH investors have staked.</p>



<p>The distinguishing element for ADA is that Cardano has a huge emphasis on scientific literature. Their progressive methods must be approved by academics all around the world. In a sense, they care equally for both quality and quantity of progress.</p>



<p>The rate at which Cardano is expanding is a testament to their forward thinking methods. With smart contracts, stablecoin  &#8220;Djed&#8221; and many more additions coming to the platform, ADA is looking like a snack!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Algorand</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="840" height="400" src="https://blog.hi.exchange/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/How-to-Exchange-Algorand-ALGO-to-PayPal-lowest-Fees-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-5095" srcset="https://hi.exchange/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/How-to-Exchange-Algorand-ALGO-to-PayPal-lowest-Fees-1.jpg 840w, https://hi.exchange/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/How-to-Exchange-Algorand-ALGO-to-PayPal-lowest-Fees-1-300x143.jpg 300w, https://hi.exchange/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/How-to-Exchange-Algorand-ALGO-to-PayPal-lowest-Fees-1-768x366.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px" /></figure>



<p>Officially launched in 2019, Algorand is a proof of stake blockchain network with great emphasis on scalability and speed. As on open-source and decentralized network, Algorand is not a new idea to begin with. However, where it proves to be different is the unique design that allows for faster consensus. With a two-tiered structure, this payment-focused network achieves amazing scalability.</p>



<p>Currently, Algorand network can process over 1000 transactions per second while transaction finality takes less than five seconds. At this point you might say that there are faster networks out there. Well, yes but actually no!</p>



<p>We’ve previously talked about the blockchain trilemma on this blog. Essentially, it is difficult and rare for a blockchain to offer security, speed and decentralization. For example, Solana network is one of the fastest ones out there but it is not that decentralized. In that regard, Algorand is maintaining all positive aspects of an ideal blockchain at once.</p>



<p>ALGO is currently 29th in the ranks with a market cap of $4.6 billion. You can buy ALGO on <a href="http://www.hi.exchange" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jolixo</a>.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><a href="http://polkadot.network" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Polkadot</a></strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="840" height="400" src="https://blog.hi.exchange/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Polkadot_OG.jpg" alt="Polkadot - top 5 altcoins" class="wp-image-3439" srcset="https://hi.exchange/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Polkadot_OG.jpg 840w, https://hi.exchange/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Polkadot_OG-300x143.jpg 300w, https://hi.exchange/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Polkadot_OG-768x366.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px" /></figure>



<p>And here we have yet another third generation blockchain network found by a previous Ethereum member. Initially, Gavin James Wood had a different vision in mind about the (PoS) algorithm. The final goal is to create an infrastructure to create a network of blockchains that are effortlessly communicating with each other.</p>



<p>The multiple blockchain approach provides a better cross-chain interoperability and easier communication. Gavin believes that a single blockchain network can never be complete and a multi-chain architecture will be much more efficient.</p>



<p>The DOT is the token for this multi-chain network. It is currently number 9 by market cap. With the first ICO in 2017, it managed to raise $145 million. Despite being relatively new, it has experienced a huge growth in popularity. DOT has had one of the most successful initial coin offerings in history, raising over 200 million in two ICOs, first one in 2017 and the other in 2020.</p>



<p>All in all, DOT is a solid choice for investment for three reasons: first, the infrastructure is solid and forward looking. Second, the tremendous success can be a testament of the potential for growth. Third, the network is in no way limited to one blockchain making the future technology implementations effortless.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">VeChain</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="840" height="400" src="https://blog.hi.exchange/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/How-to-Exchange-VeChain-VET-to-PayPal-Best-Rates.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-5094" srcset="https://hi.exchange/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/How-to-Exchange-VeChain-VET-to-PayPal-Best-Rates.jpg 840w, https://hi.exchange/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/How-to-Exchange-VeChain-VET-to-PayPal-Best-Rates-300x143.jpg 300w, https://hi.exchange/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/How-to-Exchange-VeChain-VET-to-PayPal-Best-Rates-768x366.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px" /></figure>



<p>At this point, we all know how blockchain technology can go far beyond a platform for cryptocurrencies. VeChain is a perfect example of a pragmatic blockchain network designed to increase efficiency in business.</p>



<p>The network utilizes distributed ledger technology (DLT) to streamline and manage supply chain complexities. Basically, the VeChain platform enhances supply chain management and business related processes and eases the flow of information. As a sophisticated data management network, it provides a mapped out view of an organization by managing all data.</p>



<p>In a conventional supply chain ecosystem, the data for business processes can be distributed in multiple silos. This can negatively affect business flow in the ecosystem which could ultimately decrease efficiency. VeChain network solves this issue by disintermediating information from all data silos.</p>



<p>VET is currently 42 in the ranks with a market cap of almost $3 billion. It is also one of the low risk altcoins with a good track record. You can also Buy VET on <a href="http://www.hi.exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jolixo</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>From the annoying chip shortage to power outages all over the world, crypto mining is a thing of the past. Considering the power consumption, regulations will definitely come for gas guzzlers. In that regard, if there is a way forward for cryptocurrencies, it would be the green road of proof of stake. In the long run Bitcoin and Ethereum mining can very well become illegal as we’re already facing a huge energy crisis. With that in mind, we have gathered a list of top energy efficient blockchains which are also solid choices for investment in 2022. Basically, these energy efficient blockchains are ranked based on their power consumption in 2021.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">Invest in energy efficient blockchains on <a href="http://www.hi.exchange/">jolixo</a>.</span></p></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Future is Green</strong></h2>



<p>Before we proceed, let’s address the hall of shame including Bitcoin and Ethereum as the first and second worst blockchains in terms of power consumption. With 89,780,000,000 kWh each year while Ethereum consumes 17,300,000,000 kWh. To put that in perspective, an average US household consumes an average of 10,600 kWh.</p>



<p>Objectively, that kind of power consumption is too high to be able to dethrone fiat anytime soon. Of Course, the primary argument or BTC power consumption is that the network is designed to use excess electricity from power grids or green energy. But at the end of the day, mining companies are printing money like crazy and do not care for power consumption. The only way forward, is to invest in energy efficient blockchains since upcoming regulations can seriously harm the old ones.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the proof of work algorithm is also slow and archaic compared with PoS. Proof of Stake handles a lot more transactions per second while using a lot less energy. But that is a topic for another day.</p>



<p>Without Further a do, here are the most energy efficient blockchain networks right now:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. <strong>Polkadot</strong></h2>



<p>For the first spot, we have Polkadot network with only 70,237 kWh yearly consumption. This amount is only 6.6 times higher than the average US household.</p>



<p>And here we have yet another third generation blockchain network found by a previous Ethereum member. Initially, Gavin James Wood had a different vision in mind about the (PoS) algorithm. The final goal is to create an infrastructure to create a network of blockchains that are effortlessly communicating with each other.</p>



<p>The multiple blockchain approach provides a better cross-chain interoperability and easier communication. Gavin believes that a single blockchain network can never be complete and a multi-chain architecture will be much more efficient.</p>



<p>The DOT is the token for this multi-chain network. It is currently number 9 by market cap. With the first ICO in 2017, it managed to raise $145 million. Despite being relatively new, it has experienced a huge growth in popularity. DOT has had one of the most successful initial coin offerings in history, raising over 200 million in two ICOs, first one in 2017 and the other in 2020.</p>



<p>To learn everything about the network, continue reading “<a href="https://blog.hi.exchange/what-is-polkadot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">What is Polkadot</a>“</p>



<p>You can buy DOT on <a href="http://www.hi.exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jolixo</a> with the lowest exchange fees.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. <strong>Avalanche</strong></h2>



<p>Standing behind Polkadot, the Avalanche network consumes $489,311 kWh in a year. While this number is considerably higher than Polkadot, it is still an impressive figure.</p>



<p>Avalanche Blockchain, is an open, programmable smart contracts platform for decentralized applications. It was launched by AVA labs in 2020 as an Ethereum competitor. In terms of performance, the network offers light-speed transactions with scalability that is far better than Ethereum. As for the cherry on top, the transaction fees on the network are extremely low as compared with Ethereum.</p>



<p>At the same time, compared with the Solana network, the Avalanche network is far more decentralized. This will assure security and reliability for the future to come.</p>



<p>AVAX is the native token of the network and is currently 11th in the ranks. With an impressive $25.3 billion, it is continuing to close the gap with Ethereum.</p>



<p>You can Buy AVAX on <a href="http://www.hi.exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jolixo</a> with no KYC.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. <strong>Algorand</strong></h2>



<p>And the Bronze goes to Algorand with 512,670 kWh yearly consumption. ALGO has been defying expectations in the past year and is expected to shine in 2022.</p>



<p>Officially launched in 2019, Algorand is a proof of stake blockchain network with great emphasis on scalability and speed. As on open-source and decentralized network, Algorand is not a new idea to begin with. However, where it proves to be different is the unique design that allows for faster consensus. With a two-tiered structure, this payment-focused network achieves amazing scalability.</p>



<p>Currently, Algorand network can process over 1000 transactions per second while transaction finality takes less than five seconds. At this point you might say that there are faster networks out there. Well, yes but actually no!</p>



<p>We’ve previously talked about the blockchain trilemma on this blog. Essentially, it is difficult and rare for a blockchain to offer security, speed and decentralization. For example, Solana network is one of the fastest ones out there but it is not that decentralized. In that regard, Algorand is maintaining all positive aspects of an ideal blockchain at once.</p>



<p>ALGO is the native token of the network and is currently ranked 23rd with a market cap of over $8.5 billion.</p>



<p>Buy ALGO on <a href="http://www.hi.exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jolixo</a> anonymously.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. <strong>Cardano</strong></h2>



<p>The Cardano network is essentially the founder of proof of stake. Considering the massive number of transactions, Cardano has consumed 598,755 kWh last year which is stellar.</p>



<p>The Cardano project launched in 2017. It was the third generation of blockchain networks. One that successfully dealt with some of the greatest challenges of previous generations. Issues such as high gas fees and scalability by introducing the Ouroboros, a proof of stake algorithm to mine blocks which will be further explained in the article.</p>



<p>In 2017, the Cardano project started as a third-gen open-source and public blockchain platform. ADA is the native token of the platform. It is Led by Charles Hoskinson, one of the co-founders of Ethereum. Cardano had a great emphasis on being future-proof by being peer-reviewed and methodically developed by academic experts in the field. Cardano views itself as the updated version of Ethereum. Moving towards building a connected and decentralized system and providing banking services to the unbanked.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Here is a statistic, the Bitcoin blockchain network consumes as much as 8.6 million times what the US average household uses in electricity. Now, nobody in their right mind can believe that this will go on without hard hitting regulations. To be honest, considering the power outages in so many countries due to Bitcoin mining, people are turning against cryptocurrencies. Thankfully, altcoins are doing much better in terms of power consumption. On the other hand, Bitcoin maintains a massive dominance over the market. Hence, here is the conflict in our crypto story, Bitcoin is the old drunken king while altcoins are reaching for the crown. Amongst the gallant altcoins, the Polkadot network turns out to be the most energy efficient. In fact, the Polkadot network only consumes 6.6 times an average US household.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">Buy Polkadot on <a href="http://www.hi.exchange/">jolixo</a> to save the Planet!</span></p></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Polkadot Network Leads the Pack</strong></h2>



<p>According to a new <a href="https://www.carbon-ratings.com/dl/pos-report-2022" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a> by Crypto Carbon Ratings Institute (CCRI), the Polkadot network consumes the least amount of electricity. In the meantime, Bitcoin remains the polluting champion while Ethereum is as always in the second position.</p>



<p>Based on the data, DOT consumes only 6.6 times as much as an average household in electricity. Clearly, the sophisticated twist on the proof-of-stake blockchain network is the reason why, Nonetheless, it turns out not all blockchain networks are made equal.</p>



<p>As for the next best options, Tezos, Avalanche, Algorand, Cardano and Solana are following DOT’s lead.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="557" src="https://blog.hi.exchange/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Power-1024x557.jpg" alt="Polkadot Network" class="wp-image-4816" srcset="https://hi.exchange/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Power-1024x557.jpg 1024w, https://hi.exchange/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Power-300x163.jpg 300w, https://hi.exchange/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Power-768x418.jpg 768w, https://hi.exchange/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Power.jpg 1208w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p><em>“An average US household consumes about 10,600 kWh per year and therefore, the least electricity consuming network Polkadot consumes about 6.6 times the electricity and the most electricity consuming network Solana about 200 times the electricity (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2021. Bitcoin consumes much more electricity than any Proof of Stake system due to its Proof of Work consensus mechanism, resulting in the deployment of energy-intensive hardware.”</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Winter is Coming</strong></h2>



<p>Forget about what Cathie Wood and Michael Saylor and Pomp say about Bitcoin. Today, as of early 2022, the world is facing a huge energy crisis, environmental crisis, greenflation, record high gas and oil prices, historical supply-chain issues as well as multiple other lurking in the dark. Bitcoin mining goes against every effort to deal with all the above-mentioned issues. As Bitcoin grows in value, the volatility remains higher than ever. In that sense, a new wave of regulatory actions against BTC mining can seriously harm Bitcoin. Subsequently, a sharp plunge caused by regulations can also wipe out numerous innocent altcoins because of Bitcoin dominance.</p>



<p>The only remedy for the crypto market is in fact the highly efficient proof of stake algorithm. The Polkadot network maintains a good reputation in terms of reliability and scalability and now it is the most energy efficient. This news may not have a strong positive effect on DOT price but it is a significant achievement for the whole blockchain industry.</p>

<p>Have you tried minting an NFT on the Ethereum network or just simply made a transaction on it? If so, you would know about the sky-rocketing gas fees on the network. As Ethereum lags behind delivering the promise of Proof of Stake, Ethereum killers are rising up to dethrone the queen. On the other hand, Ethereum killers are achieving incredible performance indicators and proving blockhain’s utility much better than the old dogs. So much so, that in fact Bitcoin and Ethereum are starting to look obsolete as compared with the up and coming altcoins. If you’re a believer of Ethereum downfall, here are the top 5 Ethereum Killers to invest on for 2022.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">Help kill Ethereum by buying the top 5 altcoins on <a href="http://www.hi.exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jolixo</a> 🙂</span></p></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Ethereum Killers Rise!</strong></h2>



<p>First and foremost, we need to talk about the ground rules. There are multiple aspects of a blockchain network but for this article, we are specifically focused on scalability, network-fees and decentralized nature of each one. In short, we will take a look at who is actually closer to solve the blockchain trilemma.</p>



<p>It should also be noted that Ethereum 2.0 is set to debut in 2022. In that regard, Ethereum will adopt PoS algorithm which will positively affect all of the characteristics mentioned above. That being said, considering the scale of the transition and the gruesome challenges, it would be fair to maintain a little bit of pessimism. After all, Ethereum is by far the most advanced and extensive blockchain network out there. Not to be a cynic, but we will believe Ethereum 2.0 when we see it.</p>



<p>Simply speaking, Ethereum is currently behind in terms of scalability, gas-fees and environmental harm. The Proof of Work algorithm is simply an archaic technology with considerably low efficiency. Considering the critics, cryptocurrencies have a bad reputation due to the environmental harm resulted from mining and the ongoing chip shortage. With that in mind, all Ethereum killers must be PoS blockchains.</p>



<p>Without further ado, Let’s jump right in!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Solana (SOL)</strong></h2>



<p>Yes, yes, yes. We are fully aware of the network outages and the less than decentralized servers. Solana is not as good of a boy as previously thought. However, it is simply a darling amongst institutional investors and enterprises. And that is what essentially causes rallies for the price. The Solana network is arguably the fastest blockchain network as of early 2022. To make it an even better deal, the network fees are ridiculously low compared to Ethereum. Think of Solana as the Ducati of cryptocurrencies, it’s fast and exotic, but sometimes the network can act up. Interestingly, despite the hiccups on the network, the investors did not dump Solana and move on to other competitors. And that, is a positive sign since Solana labs has ensured investors that the network will not fail them once again.</p>



<p>In short, Solana is a blockchain platform for decentralized applications (DApps). The network utilizes Proof of Stake consensus algorithm. However, in a world full of PoS blockchain networks, Solana has managed to achieve some impressive figures. The network can support up to 50,000 transactions per second (TPS) and requires 400 milliseconds to build a block. With the quickly increasing number of validators currently at 1,061, the network is one of the fastest out there.</p>



<p>However, what good is a fast network if expensive? Well, in terms of transaction fees, the Solana network maintains the most competitive fees across the board. With an average of $0.00025 per transaction, it’s no wonder why many of the largest institutional investors use this network.</p>



<p>This flexible network has smart contract capabilities, DeFi, NFT, Web3 and many more. According to the official website, the ecosystem has currently over 400 running projects.</p>



<p>To learn everything about the network, continue reading “<a href="https://blog.hi.exchange/what-is-solana/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">What is Solana?</a>”</p>



<p>You can Buy SOL with the lowest fees on <a href="http://www.hi.exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jolixo</a></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Cardano (ADA)</strong></h2>



<p>Arguably, Cardano is the well-behaved good boy in your school who reminds the teacher of the forgotten homework. Just look at Charles Hoskinson, an academic-oriented man who double checks everything and is not in a hurry to pump ADA. The Cardano network has perhaps the best reputation for a network. Low gas-fees, high scalability and truly decentralized are what you get from Cardano. Subsequently, Cardano is like the Honda of cryptocurrencies, reliable, robust and sensible. It may not be as fast as a Ducati (Solana) but it’ll go further. Motorcycle references aside, Cardano is going that extra mile to ensure the investors of the security and utility of the network. The peer-reviewed developments are something that nobody else is willing to do.</p>



<p>In 2017, the Cardano project started as a third-gen open-source and public blockchain platform. ADA is the native token of the platform. It is Led by Charles Hoskinson, one of the co-founders of Ethereum. Cardano had a great emphasis on being future-proof by being peer-reviewed and methodically developed by academic experts in the field. Cardano views itself as the updated version of Ethereum. Moving towards building a connected and decentralized system and providing banking services to the unbanked.</p>



<p>To answer what is ADA, we first need to introduce the Cardano project. As a blockchain network, Cardano is an extensive ecosystem with the native token ADA. Cardano takes pride in being one of the first pioneers of the proof of stake algorithm. And surely a successful one at that. It managed to successfully eliminated many of the issues related to crypto. It did an astonishing job dealing with Problems such as high gas fees, scalability and high transaction fees. During this process, ADA, gained immense popularity and rose through the ranks like a champ!</p>



<p>You can Buy ADA with the Lowest fees on <a href="http://www.hi.exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jolixo</a>.</p>



<p>To learn everything about Cardano, continue reading&#8221; <a href="https://blog.hi.exchange/what-is-ada-a-guide-to-the-cardano-project/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">What is ADA?</a>&#8220;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Polkadot (DOT)</strong></h2>



<p>Ironically, two of the five Ethereum killers of our list belong to former Ethereum developers. Both Cardano and Polkadot founders used to be primary founders of Ethereum. Considering the state of Ethereum in early 2022, it is not difficult to guess why!</p>



<p>Polkadot is one of the most innovative blockchain networks that successfully gave birth to an impossible idea. What if there was a blockchain network that could connect all other blockchain networks? Well, Polkadot did that and then some! The network managed to triumphantly create the “internet of blockchains” and CoinCannon the gap between other networks. As for the results, we have a highly utilitarian network that offers the best of all worlds through communication and friendship. Ultimately, Polkadot is like the KTM of cryptocurrencies since it is its own thing without looking to follow others.</p>



<p>Initially found in 2016 and launched in 2020, Polkadot is another one of those cases where an Ethereum co-founder decided to walk down the road not taken. And much like ADA, Gavin Wood was able to make waves in the industry with a revolutionary innovation. As of October 2021, Polkadot Coin is the 7th cryptocurrency by market cap, priced at $42. Considering the very young age, Polkadot has deep roots in the industry as a serious blockchain network. In a time period of less than two years, the network has fulfilled all of the advertised promises and is delivering astonishing results.</p>



<p>You can Buy DOT on <a href="http://www.hi.exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jolixo</a> anonymously with the lowest fees.</p>



<p>To learn everything about DOT, continue reading &#8220;<a href="https://blog.hi.exchange/what-is-polkadot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">What is Polkadot</a>?&#8221;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Avalanche (AVAX)</strong></h2>



<p>Decentralized Applications (dApps) managed to bring finally bring some real-world use cases to the public. Initially, the Ethereum network was the first one to offer smart contracts and dApps. However, he who shall be first, is not always the best. The Avalanche network climbed the ranks so quickly as a smart contracts network. In fact, the name Avalanche (AVAX) was mostly unheard of before 2021. In a short time, AVAX jumped in the ranks and as of early Q1 2022, it is 12<sup>th</sup> with a market cap of $17 billion USD. Avalanche is like the Yamaha of cryptocurrencies, it’s fast. It’s reliable and it is seriously underrated.</p>



<p>Avalanche Blockchain, is an open, programmable smart contracts platform for decentralized applications. It was launched by AVA labs in 2020 as an Ethereum competitor. In terms of performance, the network offers light-speed transactions with scalability that is far better than Ethereum. As for the cherry on top, the transaction fees on the network are extremely low as compared with Ethereum.</p>



<p>At the same time, compared with the Solana network, the Avalanche network is far more decentralized. This will assure security and reliability for the future to come.</p>



<p>You can Buy AVAX on <a href="http://www.hi.exchange" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jolixo.</a></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Terra (LUNA)</strong></h2>



<p>Stablecoins are essentially the blood running in the veins of the crypto market. As a matter of fact, the crypto industry is absolutely reliant on stablecoins. The Terra network managed to fill that gap in the stablecoins and offer an intuitive approach to cryptocurrencies. Undoubtedly, there is a lot of money to be made in providing stablecoins. Subsequently, all that money will find its way to LUNA the native token of the network. With that in mind, LUNA is backed by something that will always have a solid demand. In that sense, Terra is the Kawasaki of cryptocurrencies. Why? Well it’s accessible, but in the meantime offers awesome performance.</p>



<p>The Terra network is an open-source blockchain protocol that works as a payment platform for stablecoins. Essentially, the network creates stablecoins pegged to fiat currencies. These stablecoins constantly track the price of these fiat currencies. Within the network, users can buy, hold, trade or simply exchange all stablecoins.</p>



<p>Perhaps the biggest challenge for any stablecoin is to keep the value pegged and stable. To overcome this challenge, Terra network balances the supply and demand by their governance token LUNA. Used for both governance and mining, LUNA ensures that all stablecoins remain stable. In that regard, LUNA acts as a counterweight in the network. Users can either burn LUNA to mint Terra or simple stake LUNA.</p>



<p>You can buy LUNA on <a href="http://www.hi.exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jolixo</a> without compromising your privacy.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is Polkadot?</strong></h2>



<p>Polkadot is a unique blockchain network that allows the users to create their own blockchains.&nbsp; Essentially, it is trying to create a network of blockchains that are connected and interoperable. The goal is to create interoperability among blockchain networks. The network utilizes proof of stake algorithm and has been very successful.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Exchange Polkadot to PayPal on CoinCannon</strong></h2>



<p>We all know how difficult it is to find a suitable exchange platform that meets all our demands. Truthfully, considering the bad publicity regarding cryptocurrencies, it is also hard to trust online platforms.</p>



<p>Furthermore, a vast majority of exchanges require KYC which is the opposite of why cryptocurrencies exist. Your personal information is your property and you should not have to disclose your private data to anyone. In that regard, no KYC is some sort of luxury at this point. A kind of luxury that will cost you in transaction fees.</p>



<p>Luckily, CoinCannon offers everything altogether. No KYC, no sign up process, yet the platform offers the most competitive exchange rates. You can monitor the best rates on websites such as <a href="http://www.bestchange.com/">BestChange</a> and <a href="http://www.okchanger.com/">OkChanger</a> to see it for yourselves.</p>



<p>And for the utmost convenience, the platform offers 24/7 customer support.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why Exchange to PayPal?</strong></h2>



<p>PayPal is at this point the number one financial platform for digital currencies. In terms of security of your assets, they provide great services. As compared with a bank, keeping money in PayPal account can save you some tax payments in the future. It is widely accepted as a payment method and simply makes a lot of sense. Having enjoyed incredible returns on your DOT investment, you can easily transfer the asset to your PayPal account.</p>

<p>Polkadot reached an all-time high on November 3<sup>rd</sup> as anticipation for the parachain auctions grows. DOT climbed the ladder all the way up to $53 before going for a price correction at the time of writing this article. The parachain auctions allow developers to acquire funds for their projects within the community. Learn all about the network is “<a href="https://blog.hi.exchange/what-is-polkadot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">What is Polkadot</a>”.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Polkadot Rising</strong></h2>



<p>Although DOT has not been having strong rallies lately, the gradual and persistent growth continues on. The upcoming parachain auctions have the investors excited as it is an industry-first technology that can be beneficial for both users and developers. We have previously called DOT as one of the best <a href="https://blog.hi.exchange/top-5-altcoins-for-a-low-risk-investment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">low-risk altcoin</a> candidates for investment.</p>



<p>Learn how to <a href="https://blog.hi.exchange/exchange-cryptocurrency-to-paypal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exchange Polkadot to PayPal</a> anonymously with the best possible exchange rate at any moment on <a href="http://www.hi.exchange" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jolixo</a>.</p>



<p>DOT is up 30% in 7 days with a price of $52.8 at the time of writing this article. With a market cap of over $55 billion, DOT is currently ranked as 7<sup>th</sup> cryptocurrency. Data Provided by <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/polkadot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CoinGecko</a>.</p>



<p>The growth is primarily caused by the possibility of implementing parachain auctions on the network. At this stage, a governing council must first approve the upgrade. However, by the looks of it, investors are rushing to join the party.</p>



<p>Renowned crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe states that the hype and momentum revolving around DOT is a bullish sign for the price.</p>



<p>“There’s parachains coming up. There’s hype around Polkadot. Lots of momentum here. So where should you be buying Polkadot at this instance? And we have been discussing that in the updates previously, too. The entire green zone [$35 -$37] was the critical level that you preferably want to see Polkadot sustain.” Said Poppe on YouTube. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Initially, Poppe is expecting the next target zones to be at $75 and then $115. These potential target areas are determined by the Fibonacci extension tool. An apparatus that the CoinCannon <a href="https://blog.hi.exchange/category/altcoin-price-analysis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">technical analysis</a> team uses regularly.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Parachain Auctions</strong></h2>



<p> The unique architecture allows the users to create their own blockchains. The secondary blockchains are called parachains. For a complete guide, read <a href="https://blog.hi.exchange/what-is-polkadot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“What is Polkadot”</a>.</p>



<p>The parachain auctions allow DOT developers to simply select a parachain, register their projects on it and receive crowd loan funding for the project.</p>



<p>Essentially, if approved, the auctions can potentially fund useful projects that will benefit both sides of the fence.</p>



<p>In terms of utility, it is too early to comment on how the apparatus will perform. However, it is essentially the hype and momentum around a certain cryptocurrency that can cause rallies in short-term.</p>



<p>The auctions will go live with a total of 11. There will be one auction per week.</p>

<p>Bitcoin, Cardano and Polkadot have had massive institutional money inflows as top cryptocurrencies. The three managed to outperform all the rest in the third consecutive bullish weeks of October. This is all happening in a time when a vast majority of cryptocurrencies are approaching their ATH.</p>



<p>You can learn more about <a href="https://blog.hi.exchange/what-is-ada-a-guide-to-the-cardano-project/">ADA</a> and <a href="https://blog.hi.exchange/what-is-polkadot/">Polkadot</a> from our articles.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bitcoin, Cardano and Polkadot</strong></h2>



<p>The digital asset manager CoinShares revealed in their <a href="https://medium.com/coinshares/volume-51-digital-asset-fund-flows-weekly-c22873895a0b">weekly report</a>. As a surprise to no one, Bitcoin stood out on top. However, as bloggers would say, the second and third place might surprise you.</p>



<p>With a staggering total inflow of $80 million, about $70 million went into Bitcoin. It is exactly the 5<sup>th</sup> consecutive week of inflows for the lucky BTC.</p>



<p>On the other hand, Cardano (ADA) and Polkadot (DOT) were the ones amongst altcoins to stand behind Bitcoin. In the meantime, Ethereum had minor outflows which we will later discuss.</p>



<p>Cardano (ADA) had $2.7 million inflows as Polkadot performed better with $3.6 million inflows.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="872" height="731" src="https://blog.hi.exchange/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1-EHaTXGN1itvId9dc8FEcrA.png" alt="" class="wp-image-4047" srcset="https://hi.exchange/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1-EHaTXGN1itvId9dc8FEcrA.png 872w, https://hi.exchange/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1-EHaTXGN1itvId9dc8FEcrA-300x251.png 300w, https://hi.exchange/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1-EHaTXGN1itvId9dc8FEcrA-768x644.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 872px) 100vw, 872px" /></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Reason for This</strong></h2>



<p>Primarily, as the market remains bullish, it is only natural for top performers to gain more capital. Just this past week, CoinShares hit a record of assets under management thanks to the price appreciation and the inflows.</p>



<p>“<em>These inflows, combined with positive price action over the week, have pushed total assets under management (AuM) to US$72.3bn, their highest level on record, surpassing the previous record of US$71.6bn set in May this year.”</em> Says CoinShares.</p>



<p>However, as inflation keeps looming ahead, institutions are hedging against it with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Read more about <a href="https://blog.hi.exchange/as-inflation-grows-institutions-buy-bitcoin/">inflation and Bitcoin</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why not Ethereum</strong></h2>



<p>Simply speaking, Ethereum is not doing so well right now. High transaction fees and slower network as compared with the competition is primarily what is causing outflows.</p>



<p>There is an ironic story here somewhere as both Charles Hoskinson and Gavin Woods were Ethereum co-founders. To give you the daily dose of gossip here is what happened. They broke up with Ethereum (Vitalik Buterin) due to ideological differences. And now, both their projects are outperforming Ethereum.</p>



<p>On the other hand, Ethereum has promised us a total reformation. Ethereum 2.0 is expected to happen very soon. Until then, the network’s poor performance will likely cause minor outflows.</p>

<p>If you are looking to buy or sell DOT coin, you can <a href="https://blog.hi.exchange/exchange-cryptocurrency-to-paypal/">learn how</a> to exchange DOT or other digital currencies with complete anonymity on <a href="http://hi.exchange">jolixo</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Content</strong></h2>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Polkadot the Young</strong></li><li><strong>How the Polkadot Network Functions</strong></li><li><strong>Blocks and Chains Everywhere</strong></li><li><strong>Polkadot CoinCannon</strong></li><li><strong>The Blockchain Trilemma</strong></li><li><strong>DOT Coin</strong></li><li><strong>Buy and Sell Polkadot on CoinCannon</strong></li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Polkadot the Young</strong></h2>



<p>Initially found in 2016 and launched in 2020, Polkadot is another one of those cases where an Ethereum co-founder decided to walk down the road not taken. And much like <a href="https://blog.hi.exchange/what-is-ada-a-guide-to-the-cardano-project/">ADA</a>, Gavin Wood was able to make waves in the industry with a revolutionary innovation. As of October 2021, Polkadot Coin is the 7<sup>th</sup> cryptocurrency by market cap, priced at $42. Considering the very young age, Polkadot has deep roots in the industry as a serious blockchain network. In a time period of less than two years, the network has fulfilled all of the advertised promises and is delivering astonishing results.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How the Polkadot Network Functions</strong></h2>



<p>Blockchain networks such as Ethereum allow the users to create their decentralized applications. Polkadot however, takes it a step further by allowing users to create their own blockchain network on the main network. This allows for the new blockchain to take advantage of the already existing security measures of the Polkadot blockchain. DApps on the other hand, require newly created security since they cannot have access to the main network’s security protocols.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Blocks and Chains Everywhere</strong></h2>



<p>The Polkadot network or in other terms the internet of blockchain networks contains two different blockchain types. The primary blockchains, or the main networks are called relay chain. The transactions are relay chains are permanent and they are limited in nature. They act as foundation for the user created blockchains to be built upon them. The second type or the user created blockchains are called parachains</p>



<p>Utilizing this smart design,parachains can be heavily customized, they have the benefit of having security protocols of the main network since day one. This witty structure allows for lower gas fees since there is far less need for computational horsepower .</p>



<p>On the other hand, the efficiency in design allows for more privacy as the user data is not on public networks.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Polkadot CoinCannon</strong></h2>



<p>Relays and parachains aside, the Polkadot network is certainly not shy. The relay can make CoinCannons into other networks such as Bitcoin and Ethereum using parachains. In that regard, they are able to interact and gain access to almost any blockchain they want. This design allows for a future of interoperability for blockchain networks. Certainly, it would be much appreciated in the future where the technology expands. In that case the need for communication and interoperability will surely increase. Furthermore, other blockchain networks can also benefit from these connecting CoinCannons.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Blockchain Trilemma</strong></h2>



<p>The blockchain trilemma suggest that creators must compromise by choosing two out of three essential qualities of decentralization, speed and security. We can see the Ethereum network dealing with high transaction fees and lower transaction speed. Or as of late, it turned out that despite the low fees and high transaction speed, the Solana network was very much centralized.</p>



<p>The interoperability strategy that the Polkadot proposes, can potentially deal with all the aforementioned issues. After all, if all blockchains networks unite, no one can defeat them.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>DOT Coin</strong></h2>



<p>As no blockchain network is complete without a native token, the DOT coin is the running blood in the veins. With a market cap of $42 billion, DOT is 7<sup>th</sup> in the ranks with a price of $42 according to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/polkadot-new/">CoinMarketCap</a>.</p>



<p>In terms of fundamental analysis, considering the utility of the network, it is a safe assumption to have a long position on DOT.</p>



<p>Think 1 million transactions per second, or transaction fees much lower than any other network. On top of that, you have a network that connects all other networks. The team behind the network has demonstrated that they can deliver. And with the fast pace developments of blockchain technology, Polkadot network is a great medium for both development and communication.</p>



<p>In that scenario, we are bullish on DOT.</p>
