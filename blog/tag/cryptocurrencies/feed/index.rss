<p>In today’s interconnected world, online payments are the heart of global commerce. However, for many users in countries like Russia, Iran, Venezuela, and Cuba, accessing trusted international payment gateways such as PayPal, Visa, and MasterCard remains a significant challenge. These obstacles, often caused by laws, currency restrictions, or regional rules, leave individuals and businesses struggling to complete essential online transactions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Recognizing these difficulties, CoinCannon offers an innovative solution: <a href="https://hi.exchange/En/solutions/online-payment">Online Payment</a>, a service that allows users to avoid traditional barriers and complete payments quickly, securely, and without the need for challenging account setups or verifications.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-nbsp-what-is-online-payment-nbsp-nbsp">&nbsp;What Is Online Payment?&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>

<li><strong>PayPal: </strong>A popular choice for freelancers and gamers due to its versatility.  </li>

<li><strong>Perfect Money:</strong> Frequently used in hosting, VPS services, and entertainment platforms.  </li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>To think about it, a gigantic and inefficient global monetary system is all we’ve got. Lead by unelected individuals who god knows who they are, this system can make or break the fate of the world. To put it simply, policies of this sector can affect pretty much all lives around the world. Now, before this article starts to turn into a second communist manifesto, there was in fact a second coming of Marxist idealism sometime back in 2008. This time, it was more practical yet the creator that is Satoshi remains anonymous. The seemingly decentralized and revolutionary system was at first true to its nature. Decentralized, anonymous and independent of the global monetary system. In fact, crypto filled a void that pointed out the embarrassing flaws of the conventional boomer banking system of the old days.</p>



<p>However, efficiency and utility will always call for the appeal to expand and to grow. And this isolated system that is crypto, managed to branch out into banks and hedge funds and institutions as the ultimate financial apparatus. More capital flowed into the market and adoption took a rapid momentum. In the meantime, function and utility had some improvement but did not develop as much as it needed.</p>



<p>Subsequently, mass adoption brought out centralized industry titans such as Binance and Coinbase and FTX. Soon, there was a cult forming around crypto thanks to a tremendous boom in popularity. Figures like Michael Saylor and Elon Musk spread the good word of hodl and persuaded retail investors to have faith in computer codes and algorithms which they had no idea how they functioned.</p>



<p>Sadly, the utility of crypto did not keep up with the growing popularity. But worry not, useless functions and marketing schemes like NFTs and shitcoins kept the market afloat for a while. But soon, in this isolated (unregulated) crypt market, Entropy began to turn into chaos. Somewhere, in the drug infused orgies of billionaire crypto entrepreneurs, something went wrong.</p>



<p>And here we are, in the post Luna crash and <a href="https://hi.exchange/blog/ftx-collapse/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FTX collapse</a> era. Elon is still pumping the market to no avail and Saylor keeps shitposting on Twitter. Yet, retail investors do not believe a word. And finally, the global monetary system seems to be going after crypto. But here’s the catch, they will not try to bring down crypto, but rather swallow and integrate crypto into their own kerfuffle. And there is our bottom line, most, if not all crypto CEOs will gladly accept the overlords’ terms. After all, can’t beat them, join ‘em.</p>



<p>And how will the global monetary system bring crypto into its own corrupt embrace? Regulations!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-undying-global-monetary-system"><strong>The Undying Global Monetary System</strong></h2>



<p>The executive board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) have <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2023/02/23/pr2351-imf-executive-board-discusses-elements-of-effective-policies-for-crypto-assets" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">expressed</a> their concerns about crypto assets. According to IMF, the board considers crypto assets and their rising adoption a threat.</p>



<p>For the most part, they all agree that crypto assets will have crucial implications on the UN financial agency’s mandate and policies. With that, what they do demand is providing guidance regarding policy response to crypto assets.</p>



<p>“In particular, the widespread adoption of crypto assets could undermine the effectiveness of monetary policy, circumvent capital flow management measures, and exacerbate fiscal risks. Widespread adoption could also have significant implications for the international monetary system in the longer term.”</p>



<p>To put it simply, IMF directors are calling for countries that are adoption crypto to adopt effective strategies. What that means is that they are fighting to keep their grasp on the financial system of such countries.</p>



<p>“Directors, therefore, emphasized that robust macroeconomic policies, including credible institutions and monetary policy frameworks are first-order requirements and that Fund advice in these areas will remain crucial.”</p>



<p>Now, with all the scandalous <a href="https://hi.exchange/blog/pump-and-dump-crypto/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pump and dump crypto</a> schemes, regulators are finding it easy to impose more regulations.</p>



<p>Perhaps, cryptocurrencies may have had their debut as decentralized and independent. Satoshi may have been a revolutionary figure who did not seem to want to compromise and wanted to bring down the global monetary system with a bang. But the reality of the situation is far from what is promised.</p>



<p>When all is said and done, crypto industry is now more centralized than decentralized. And the massive influence that a few individuals have over the market will eventually make the market a lost cause. With that, this article predicts that crypto assets will integrate into the global monetary system. Maybe not today, but sometime in the future cryptocurrencies will be fully and extensively regulated. And then, the global monetary system will finally have its own prodigal son back!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>CoinCannon for the Win!</strong></h2>



<p>Essentially, you need three primary qualities in an ideal exchange platform. Anonymity, good rates and reliability. The CoinCannon team consists of traders and professionals who have felt the need for an ideal exchange and pursued their vision.</p>



<p>First and foremost, all users need to protect their personal information especially when it comes down to financial transactions. Unfortunately, a vast majority of exchange apps and platforms make massive profits off of selling user data. Best case scenario, they are legally bound to disclose user information with national authorities for any reason. In that regard, the best method to protect your privacy is to not disclose them with anyone at all. CoinCannon does not require customers to go through KYC (know your customer) or even a mandatory sign up. In that regard, it is simply as safe as one can get making an exchange.</p>



<p>On the other hand, privacy is not a reason to pay more on your exchange. With that in mind, the platform offers some of the most competitive exchange rates you can find anywhere. Don’t take our word for it. You can simply pay a visit to ranking websites such as BestChange or OkChanger and see compare our rates with others.</p>



<p>Last but not least, not everything goes as planned in the digital world. Subsequently, the platform provides true online 24/7 customer support for the users.</p>

<p>When you are done hodling, comes the time to exchange crypto and cash out your profit. But, with so many options around, users may face some confusion as to what they should do. Essentially, both PayPal and Perfect Money are very practical payment systems but depending on the use case, they have some fundamental differences. As an exchange platform, we offer both solutions but here is our guide as to which one is better for you to exchange crypto.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why Exchange Crypto to PayPal</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="840" height="400" src="https://blog.hi.exchange/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/How-to-Make-PayPal-Payments-in-Russia-No-Commission.jpg" alt="exchange crypto" class="wp-image-5104" srcset="https://hi.exchange/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/How-to-Make-PayPal-Payments-in-Russia-No-Commission.jpg 840w, https://hi.exchange/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/How-to-Make-PayPal-Payments-in-Russia-No-Commission-300x143.jpg 300w, https://hi.exchange/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/How-to-Make-PayPal-Payments-in-Russia-No-Commission-768x366.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px" /></figure>



<p>PayPal is a digital payment service that can be used by customers while they shop online. The platform stores payment information, such as bank account or credit card numbers, so that every time they buy something, customers do not have to type the numbers out. Also, it hides from companies this financial information, adding a layer of security to online shopping. PayPal payments can be incorporated into online checkout process by small companies and similarly by large corporations.</p>



<p>Now, while PayPal does not offer lots of anonymity, they are the top secure payment system by a mile. Considering the huge amount of regulations as well as the largest user base in the world, PayPal keeps it safe. Thankfully, transactions are reversible and the quality of service remains the benchmark in the industry.</p>



<p>Distinguishably, PayPal has so many hassles and requirements, but your assets are very safe. For that, you will face many restrictions on buying cryptocurrencies the next time yet the security is worth it.</p>



<p>So, if you want to cash out for a long time and want your assets available on various platforms, PayPal is the way to go.</p>



<p>Learn how you can <a href="https://blog.hi.exchange/how-exchange-bitcoin-to-paypal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Exchange Bitcoin to PayPal</a></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why Exchange Crypto to Perfect Money</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="840" height="400" src="https://blog.hi.exchange/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/How-to-Exchange-Perfect-Money-to-PayPal-Lowest-Fees.jpg" alt="exchange crypto" class="wp-image-4698" srcset="https://hi.exchange/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/How-to-Exchange-Perfect-Money-to-PayPal-Lowest-Fees.jpg 840w, https://hi.exchange/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/How-to-Exchange-Perfect-Money-to-PayPal-Lowest-Fees-300x143.jpg 300w, https://hi.exchange/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/How-to-Exchange-Perfect-Money-to-PayPal-Lowest-Fees-768x366.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px" /></figure>



<p>On the other hand, Perfect Money is all about lesser regulations and lesser hassle. With PM, what you get is a lot more financial freedom and privacy all while your assets are available to you as the owner at all times. Unfortunately, most people think of Perfect Money as a gray area for payment systems that is sketchy. However, PM has been around for years and for what is worth, it is actually very much reliable.</p>



<p>Sadly, in this day and age, we do not actually own our money since it’s not in our pockets. Instead, we have to trust digital networks to hold them for us and hopefully let us have it when we want them. While we praise PayPal for the security, they tend to passive-aggressively restrict our financial activities with thousands of regulations and requirements. For example, there are numerous constraints on buying cryptocurrencies with PayPal all in the name of regulations.</p>



<p>And this, is where Perfect Money shines. PM allows the user to buy and exchange crypto on platforms like <a href="http://www.hi.exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jolixo</a> in full privacy.</p>



<p>Continue reading “<a href="https://blog.hi.exchange/guide-to-exchange-perfect-money/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">What is Perfect Money</a>”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Verdict</strong></h2>



<p>In this case, it’s actually very simple to pick one. If you’re looking to store your assets for a long time, go with PayPal. PayPal offers the highest security of funds but also suffers from a vast variety of regulations. In that regard, it would be more difficult to buy cryptocurrencies the next time with PayPal. Conversely, if you want to get back in the market quick, exchange crypto to Perfect Money. Despite the reputation, PM has consistently remained as a reliable payment system. On top of that, the financial liberty is a rare gem these days and Perfect Money knows it!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The recent sell-off starting in May initially turned into a massive crypto crash. Bitcoin is currently 50% down from its all-time high while altcoins are pretty much the same. So far, the market has shown little attempt for a recovery and remains overall bearish. However, Michael Sonnenshein, the CEO of investing giant Grayscale states that investors see the latest correction as more of an opportunity. While Bitcoin has consistently followed the stock market, Sonnenshein still argues BTC can be a haven asset like gold. Tell us what you think about the latest crypto crash down in the comments.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><mark style="background-color:#ffffff" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">Exchange Cryptocurrencies to PayPal Instantly with No Fees on <a href="http://www.hi.exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jolixo</a></mark></p></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Viva La Crypto Crash</strong></h2>



<p>As the CEO of a company who sells Bitcoin to the ultra-wealthy, Sonnenshein told Yahoo Finance in a recent interview that the latest crypto crash is an opportunity. Or at least that is how the investors see it. He failed to mention how the majority of retail investors are still underwater. Furthermore, he also did not mention how could a retail investor who is underwater can see the Bitcoin sell-off as an opportunity. Sufficed to say, Sonnenshein used the term looking at the broader markets which means he could basically state whatever that comes to mind without needing for justification.</p>



<p>“I think we have to examine crypto in the context of what’s been happening in the broader markets. You’ve seen rising rates in the US [which] has caused a lot of volatility in a lot of different asset classes, crypto along with it.</p>



<p>The recent sell-off though, from what we’re hearing from investors, has not deterred them. If anything, they’re looking at it opportunistically and a pullback like this is nothing new in the crypto space.”</p>



<p>Furthermore, the CEO of the company who has the <a href="https://blog.hi.exchange/grayscale-now-holds-43-billion-in-crypto-assets/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">largest</a> Bitcoin fund worth over $43 billion in crypto said that comparing BTC to traditional assets is tricky and not quite right.</p>



<p>“Our standpoint on this is largely when you’re looking at something like Bitcoin, you’re looking at something that for us really does look, feel and act like a digital gold.</p>



<p>If you look out over a longer time horizon, you will see crypto being uncorrelated to other asset classes, although oftentimes it is scrutinized because we do only have the last 10-plus years of trading history to really examine.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Regulations</strong></h2>



<p>Sonnenshein said that he is hoping for clear regulatory guidelines that could provide growth. In that regard, proper regulations can initially speed up industry innovation.</p>



<p>“We’re spending a lot of time in DC and that’s also a reason that the Grayscale team is here in Davos. Regulation around crypto and the entire ecosystem is paramount.</p>



<p>One thing that we really would like to see on the heels of the White House executive order, what you’ve seen out of the UK government, what you’ve seen in Germany recently. A lot of governments are moving their policies and procedures forward and we’d like the US to do the same thing here.</p>



<p>We need to see regulation beyond just enforcement so that we have the proper regulatory frameworks to foster the innovation, to create job growth, to create products and services, to ensure that the innovation around this technology remains in the US, and we don’t lose our competitive advantage there.”</p>



<p>In the meantime, European Central Bank (ECB) President Christine Lagarde has officially gone on the record to say that cryptocurrencies are worth zero. With that, one can only expect brutal regulations coming out of the EU.</p>



<p>“I have said all along the crypto assets are highly speculative, very risky assets. My very humble assessment is that it is worth nothing. It is based on nothing, there is no underlying assets to act as an anchor of safety.” Said Lagarde.</p>



<p>And here we are, in a time when large institutions offer an exaggerated image of reality. All while regulators have waged war against cryptocurrencies. Perhaps, the truth is somewhere in the middle. But, the synthesis of such clash will only harm the individual investors.</p>

<p>Well, turns out Gucci is after crypto millionaires by supporting digital asset payments. The brand has been dipping their toes in the new opportunities coming from crypto and this is not their first venture. Previously, the brand officially reveled their plans to develop a virtual store in metaverse. Based in Sandbox, Gucci’s boutique would showcase virtual products and concepts as NFTs. While the NFT sales have plunged 92% as of May 2022, the brand is now accepting digital asset payments in select US stores. So get ready to pay for your next Gucci bag with Shiba Inu.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><mark style="background-color:#ffffff" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">Buy and Sell Cryptocurrencies with no fees on <a href="http://www.hi.exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jolixo</a></mark></p></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Digital Asset Payments</strong></h2>



<p>As the world slowly forgets about cash, digital asset payments are the new financial trend. The renowned fashion brand Gucci will now be accepting cryptocurrencies for payments in select stores.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.voguebusiness.com/technology/gucci-takes-the-leap-will-accept-crypto-in-us-stores" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vogue Business</a>, the luxury line will start receiving cryptocurrencies starting at the end of May. The program will kick off in select US based stores and will expand to all North American stores by the end of summer.</p>



<p>At this point, the digital asset payments are limited to 12 assets starting by the big one, which is Bitcoin. The second cryptocurrency by market cap Ethereum (ETH), memecoin Dogeoin (DOGE) and the other memecoin Shiba Inu (SHIB) are also on the list.&nbsp; Litecoin (LTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) are also on the list. In addition to that, five unnamed stablecoins are also on the list. It would be safe to assume that Tether USD and USD Coin are definitely included.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Pilot Program</strong></h2>



<p>The payment process will be pretty standard and straightforward. Customers can pay for their purchase with cryptocurrencies by scanning a QR code or getting a link via email. For the time being, the crypto acceptance pilot program includes stores in Los Angeles, New York, Las Vegas, Miami and Atlanta.</p>



<p>The Chief Executive Officer Marco Bizzarri said in an interview that implementing new technologies is a crucial part of their business.</p>



<p>“Gucci is always looking to embrace new technologies when they can provide an enhanced experience for our customers.</p>



<p>Now that we are able to integrate cryptocurrencies within our payment system, it is a natural evolution for those customers who would like to have this option available to them.”</p>



<p>Lately, Fashion brands have been making serious ventures into cryptocurrencies. On March, the world’s first <a href="https://blog.hi.exchange/metaverse-fashion-show/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">metaverse </a>fashion show took place in Decentraland. Back then, some of the biggest fashion brand including Tommy Hilfiger, Selfridges, Cavalli, Eli Saab, Vogue Arabia, Guo Pei and others participated in the event.</p>



<p>Considering the foggy legal state of crypto, digital asset payments can pay off big time for early adopters.</p>

<p>So far, 2021 is the golden year for crypto investment. It was a year of massive institutional adoption for crypto and multiple all-time highs. As we look back, a crypto investment in early 2021 would have been highly successful despite all the volatility. Despite all volatility, regulatory threats and bear market, investors’ profit grew a staggering %400 percent as compared with 2020. After all, turns out crypto investment was a pretty solid financial decision in 2021. And as for the year to come, only time can tell.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><mark style="background-color:#ffffff" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">Buy Cryptocurrencies anonymously on <a href="http://www.hi.exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jolixo</a><br>No KYC</mark></p></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Chainalysis on Crypto Investment</strong></h2>



<p>According to a new report by top data analytics firm Chainalysis, investing in crypto has been highly profitable in 2021. Primarily, we can see that by taking a look at the realized total gains which is upwards of $162.7 billion. To put that in perspective, investors had a total of only $32 billion in 2020.</p>



<p>According to the firm, United States stands on top by a long shot at an estimated $47 billion in realized cryptocurrency gains. So, as far-right republicans like to put it, “America First!”. Following the US’s lead, United Kingdom, Germany, Japan and China are the next countries in the ranks.</p>



<p>Interestingly, Bitcoin was not the top paying crypto investment. Instead, Ethereum managed to edge out BTC in total realized gains at $76.4 billion which is higher than Bitcoin’s $74.7 billion. According to Chainalysis, this could be due to growing demand in DeFi.</p>



<p>“We believe this reflects increased demand for Ethereum as the result of DeFi’s rise in 2021, as most DeFi protocols are built on the Ethereum blockchain and use Ethereum as their primary currency. While most individual countries follow this pattern, there are some notable exceptions. Japan, for instance, received a much higher share of realized gains from Bitcoin at just under $4.0 billion, compared to just $790 million in realized Ethereum gains,”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Best and Worst Performers</strong></h2>



<p>While the %400 growth in total realized gains is an average, it is also intriguing to see how different countries performed.</p>



<p>China, managed to record a growth of %194 in 2021 with a total estimated realized crypto gains of $5.1 billion. As impressive as it sounds, this is substantially lower than other countries and far below the average growth rate. Primarily, the lower growth rate is due to China’s brutal <a href="https://blog.hi.exchange/china-declares-all-cryptocurrency-transactions-illegal/">crackdowns</a> on cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p>On the other hand, United States realized gains surged %476 moving up from $8.1 billion to $47 billion. UK had a %431 increase and Germany witnessed %423 growth.</p>



<p>“Our analysis of cryptocurrency gains should be encouraging to the cryptocurrency world, and reflects the growth of the ecosystem in 2021 — especially in DeFi. While there are still risks the industry must work to mitigate, the data not only shows that crypto asset prices are growing, but also indicates that cryptocurrency remains a source of economic opportunity for users in emerging markets,” said Chainalysis.</p>

<p>We all knew crypto regulations were coming. Following the massive bull market in 2020 and 2021, crypto fell on the radar as a serious phenomenon that required attention. At this point crypto regulations in so many countries are far from complete. The US for example, is planning to set extensive <a href="https://blog.hi.exchange/crypto-regulations-national-security/">rules</a> for cryptocurrencies with national security urgency level. Unlike what the Twitter bulls tell us, regulations can have long-term effects on the market. Russia is another superpower that is seeking to impose crypto regulations. Unlike their friendly neighbor Ukraine, Russia is not a fan of Bitcoin. Recently, Russian government introduced the crypto bill to parliament which we will briefly go through the details in this article.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><mark style="background-color:#ffffff" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">Exchange Cryptocurrencies to PayPal on <a href="http://www.hi.exchange/">jolixo</a> with no KYC.</mark></p></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Update: On Digital Currency</h2>



<p>Russia&#8217;s Ministry of Finance has named the pending legislation as &#8220;On Digital Currency&#8221;. On Friday, the agency announced their amendment of their digital currency bull. For the most part, the crypto bill is calling for mining and trading provisions. This is essentially a an updated version of the original draft that came out in February. </p>



<p>Generally, the updates revolve around provisions on mining and trading digital currencies. Interestingly, Russia has grown interest in cryptocurrencies considering their financial situation. In that regard, there seems to be a noticeable reconsideration on crypto in Russia.</p>



<p>Russia&#8217;s central bank called for a total ban of cryptocurrency mining in January. Basically, the bank stated that cryptocurrencies could cause financial instability. However, as the tides turned, the ban does not seem to be a counter-intuitive move for the country. </p>



<p>As a response to sanctions, Russia&#8217;s Sberbank was granted a license to start issuing digital assets. These assets will exist on the bank&#8217;s digital platform and would be recorded and circulated utilizing a distributed ledger technology system. According to Sberbank, this would ensure &#8220;data security&#8221; and immutability.</p>



<p>Similarly, other companies can apply for this license and issue their digital assets. As for requirements, companies must meet the cash requirements and utilize digital assets issued through the information system provided by the bank.</p>



<p>Thus far, crypto regulations in Russia are unclear and uncertain to say the least. The updated version of the bill introduces professional and non-professional digital asset purchases as new concepts according to <a href="https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/5306943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Kommersant</a>. Furthermore, the bill calls for the need to asses crypto products and reconsider the rules for mining and trading. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Russian Bear Market</strong></h2>



<p>The Ministry of Finance in Russia is following the plan to regulate cryptocurrencies with a bill introduced to the parliament. Basically, the plan follows a roadmap developed by multiple government bodies. The bill reached parliament on February 18<sup>th</sup>.</p>



<p>And how does it look? Well, the Bank of Russia wants to shoot crypto in the head with a shotgun. The Central Bank is opposing regulations as it is calling for a total ban on mining and trading cryptocurrencies. In the meantime, the central bank is developing their CBDC the digital ruble. Currently, the Bank of Russia will fine crypto trading up to 500,000 rubles (US$6,360) for individuals and 1 million rubles for companies.</p>



<p>At this point, the official draft for the bill remains unavailable but the Ministry of Finance said that they were considering the objections of the Central Bank. Having said that, there are fragments of the bill available to the public.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Crypto Regulations to Come</strong></h2>



<p>First and foremost, cryptocurrencies will not be a legal tender in Russia which will make Nayib Bukele very sad. This means that Tesla will never be able to accept Dogecoin from Russians. Subsequently, crypto is solely an investment tool and cannot be a payment method for goods and services.</p>



<p>Secondly, all crypto exchanges and OTC desks must obtain a license and fit into some certain criteria. As for foreign exchanges, they must register legal entities in Russia to be able to work.</p>



<p>Thirdly, all crypto-to-fiat transactions will conduct through bank accounts and users will have to go through KYC (know your customer) twice (one for bank, one for exchange).</p>



<p>But this is perhaps the best one yet. Investors must pass an online test to prove they maintain sufficient knowledge about crypto and its associated risks. Those who pass, will be able to invest up to 600,000 rubles a year. As for those who fails, they will be limited to 50,000 rubles.</p>



<p>As for mining, the Central Bank is looking to ban it once and for all. However, the details regarding that are still unclear.</p>

<p>If only there was a leading social media ecosystem that could push its native crypto asset! Well, apparently, “Zuck Bucks” are the future as Meta is now officially working on its own crypto asset. Having completely forgotten about Facebook’s terrible reputation since the name change, it is now time for the next step. Recently, a <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/50fbe9ba-32c8-4caf-a34e-234031019371" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a> published by Financial Times sheds light on Zuckerberg’s plan for a critical leap ahead for Meta. All that said, there could be a huge investment opportunity ahead considering the scale of Meta’s crypto asset.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Exchange Cryptocurrencies to PayPal Instantly on <a href="http://www.hi.exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jolixo</a><br>No KYC</p></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Meta’s Crypto Asset</strong></h2>



<p>As we all know, life in physical form is totally overrated. In that regard, metaverse is the new America and luckily, conquering the land of NPCs is totally ethical. With that in mind, Meta is racing toward creating the leading metaverse. Subsequently, Meta is looking to develop its own cryptocurrency specifically for the developing metaverse.</p>



<p>As for details, all we know at this point is that Meta employees are calling the token “Zuck Bucks” which is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3R4sPcngP0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hilarious</a>. However, the sources noted that at this point, the development is not official. In fact, Meta might push back or cancel the development at any point.</p>



<p>Furthermore, Meta is considering creating social tokens as well as community-based coins. Similiarly, Reddit is utilizing the same tokens mainly to reward contributions. But that’s not all, the company may also issue creator coins or tokens for individual influencers on Instagram. Therefore, the reports indicated a massive plan to develop a digital ecosystem consisting of coins and tokens rather than a single crypto asset.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>That Makes Sense!</strong></h2>



<p>According to FT, Meta could potentially remove itself from being a centralized force of moderation. Basically, a crypto asset as well as the tokens enable communities to keep themselves in check.</p>



<p>Despite the unofficial nature of this report, there seems to be a solid investment opportunity for early adopters. To put it simply, the demand for Meta’s crypto asset can and will be seriously high. And that is not because you want to use Meta’s services, but you have to! Instagram may or may not be spying on users but honestly none of us can stop looking at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/iamlilbub/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lil Bub</a> (RIP Legend).</p>



<p>Despite this early phase of development, Meta is working on a massive project that already benefits from a large potential investor base. Therefore, it is most definitely worth to keep an eye on Zuck Bucks.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Crypto regulations are coming and they are coming like Miley Cyrus riding a wrecking ball. The Biden administration is gearing up toward a massive wave of regulations. In fact, crypto regulations are now urged to be treated as a matter of national security. Needless to say, this is the same administration that printed massive amounts of money and caused the hyperinflation. Apparently, there is an executive plan to release soon with tasks for federal agencies regarding cryptocurrencies. For the most part, crypto regulations have been pretty light considering the stock market regulations. In the stock market, you could get crucified for pumping the market like Elon is doing DOGE on Twitter. Unfortunately, regulations are not good news for a market of cryptographic and anonymous transactions. Stay with us as we go over the details of the executive plan.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Buy and Sell Cryptocurrencies on <a href="http://www.hi.exchange" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jolixo</a> as a Matter of Financial Security!</p></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Crypto Regulations on the Horizon</strong></h2>



<p>Initially, an unknown source familiar with the plan told <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/white-house-executive-action-regulate-cryptos-national-security-51643312454" rel="nofollow">Barron’s</a> about the upcoming plan of action. Primarily, regulating cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are now a matter of national security. Interestingly, Russia is taking a similar approach. As part of the national security memorandum which is to release in a few weeks, multiple government agencies must analyze digital assets and provide a framework. This includes cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, NFTs. Long and short of it, the plan is to task related agencies with analyzing, research and a proposal for the legal framework. Finally, the White House will make the subsequent decision and reach a consensus.</p>



<p>“<em>This is designed to look holistically at digital assets and develop a set of policies that give coherency to what the government is trying to do in this space,”</em> said the source.</p>



<p>The State Department, Treasury Department, National Economic Council and Council of Economic Advisers are contributing to the executive plan. However, The White House National Security Council is also investigating crypto regulations. So far, United States has remained very tolerant of cryptocurrencies but this news comes as a strong signal toward the crypto market.</p>



<p>“<em>Because digital assets don’t stay in one country, it’s necessary to work with other countries on synchronization</em>.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Crypto Regulations Are That Serious<strong>?</strong></h2>



<p>Undoubtedly, at least for the United States, a national security matter is of utmost urgency and significance. In that regard, it is hard to maintain an optimistic view. On the other hand, it could also be a blessing in disguise. At this point, there are too many agencies with jurisdiction on the crypto market.</p>



<p>“<em>Various agencies oversee the industry, including the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. But there’s no consensus on matters such as whether some tokens should be registered as securities, or how to oversee exchanges, stablecoins, and high-yield lending products.</em>&#8220;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">US Legislators Oppose </h2>



<p>As of March 19th, more than half a dozen United States congressmen are objecting this decision. Primarily, they are against the severe regulatory pressure for the harm it could impose on developers. </p>



<p>With a letter sent to US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) head Gary Gensler, Tom Emmer from Minnesota leads this bipartisan group. In essence, the legislators are saying that the over-extensive information requirements are a risk for stifling domestic technological innovation in this sector.</p>



<p><em>“Crypto startups must not be weighed down by extra-jurisdictional and burdensome reporting requirements.</em></p>



<p><em>The SEC must ensure that its information-seeking requests to private crypto and blockchain firms are not overburdensome, unnecessary, and do not stifle innovation.”</em></p>



<p>SEC&#8217;s Gary Gensler has clearly took a stand against cryptocurrencies calling them <a href="https://blog.hi.exchange/secs-gary-gensler-skeptic-of-crypto-signals-crackdowns/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wild west</a>. However, the Minnesota congressman pointed out in a Tweet that the SEC must honor a 1980 law that protects americans from overwhelming documentation requirements. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">While the SEC has authority to obtain info from market participants for rulemaking purposes, it must ensure that these inquiries don&#39;t infringe on the standards established in the Paperwork Reduction Act, which limits the burden the govt. imposes on private businesses &amp; citizens.</p>&mdash; Tom Emmer (@GOPMajorityWhip) <a href="https://twitter.com/GOPMajorityWhip/status/1504117937174683651?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 16, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Brace Yourselves?</strong></h2>



<p>Not quite yet! The executive plan will provide the agencies between three to six months to study the matter and work on a cohesive regulation framework. Realistically, the plan would take at least three quarters to have any meaningful impact. Despite the national security level of importance, navy seals cannot take Bitcoin down.</p>



<p>Frankly, the US has been acting strange about cryptocurrencies and crypto regulations. In a perfect world, regulations would be imposed on a market with the same rate of growth in market cap. In this case, it seems that the country has not been taking crypto seriously and all of a sudden they feel threatened. This lack of attention and possible negligence can seriously harm the investors since it could create a sudden bearish shock wave. Anyhow, at least the US will not ban crypto overnight like China or Russia did right? Right?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>cryptocurrencies are at this point bombarded with highly coordinated and well-funded marketing endeavors. Unfortunately, we see technical terms flying around while they don’t mean nothing to no one. After all, nobody will be in it for the tech without some sweet returns on their investment. In a sad turn of events, the Russia-Ukraine conflict has portrayed the significance of one of those overly-commercialized terms that is “decentralized”. Suddenly, a war breaks out in Europe where millions of people have to pack up everything and go. Can you withdraw from a bank in this situation? Are the banks even open? If not for war, what would you do if everyone panicked overnight and lined up to cash out on the ATM machines? </p>



<p>This terrifying experience has happened three times in February alone. Canada, Ukraine and Russia had their people rushing to empty their bank accounts, out of fear, out of desperation and perhaps with a rightful tendency to save their well-earned capital. Skeptics doubt Tether about their dollar reserves, but do the banks have all the assets in your cards printed and ready to go? In this uprising of devastating turmoil, cryptocurrencies are saving lives with an infrastructure that is immune to all missile strikes. In a time when bank servers are basically electrical waste, Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies are safe in their owners’ pockets.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">Buy Cryptocurrencies Instantly on <a href="http://www.hi.exchange/">jolixo</a>. <br>[No KYC or Sign Up Required]</span></p></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Cryptocurrencies Matter!</strong></h2>



<p>Frankly, this is not a love letter crypto coming from a Midwest doomer who wants to shoot the bourgeoisie in the back of the head with a BB gun. In fact, the marketing strategies and the advertised content created by giant exchange apps are revolting to say the least. We do not need Hollywood and TV stars telling us to be bold and invest in the future while they surrender user data to the highest bidder. In fact, Changpeng Zhao can Tweet his libertarian stream of consciousness all day long and we’d still know how he shares transaction information with governments just for a competitive edge over Coinbase and KuCoin.</p>



<p>Having expressed my utter resentment for crypto moguls (like Elon), here is credit where it’s due. Cryptocurrencies are out there in Ukraine, available for payment, holding their investors lifesavings while the banks are obliterated. Cryptocurrencies are now pretty much the primary method of accepting donations from others as they immediately reach their destination without any hassle. On the eastern side of the conflict, there is something going on that could make an even better case for cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p>The Russian Government has shut down the stock market. In a state of panic where the investors fear an upcoming plunge would wipe their capital, someone decided that it’s not a good time for people to pull out. Say what you will about Bitcoin whales, but at least they can’t shut down the whole market and lock your money. Surely, the volatility is a big turn off, but one must remember how fragile a banking system is.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Loudest Voice</h2>



<p>Socialist literary critics like Mikhail Bakhtin believed that each language contains multiple other sub-languages that each have their own agenda. And sometimes, one language is the dominant voice for the whole group. Today, the dominant voice is the language of marketing, oversaturated with flowery and top-shelf words meticulously designed to capitalize on our senses. Cryptocurrencies used to be cool, you could trade, hold or simply move these cryptographically secured assets without anyone knowing anything about it. They used to be ours.</p>



<p>What happened in Ukraine, Russia, Canada and what will surely happen in the future is a testament to crypto utility. Cryptocurrencies are dominated by the marketing voice of venture capitalism, drowned in the vicious advertisings of Harvard-graduates with a careless over-competitive attitude that disregards the common folk. This is why I see hope for cryptocurrencies, not because of the massive pumps in Bitcoin value and certainly not for shitcoins. I see hope for cryptocurrencies because at the end of the day, they are our only alternative for a flimsy traditional finance.</p>
