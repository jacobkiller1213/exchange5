As of 2022, Tether USDT is still the dominant stablecoin in the market and the top US dollar crypto equivalent. Whether you trade or hodl, Tether USDT is the ultimate mediator apparatus for everyone. However, although making the exchange is easy, it matters a lot which platform you choose to exchange crypto to Tether. For one, not all platforms offer the same exchange rates and you may have to pay more for the order. More importantly, anonymity is also a key feature user should keep in mind. For that, a reliable exchange platform like <a href="http://www.hi.exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jolixo</a> is absolutely necessary. In this article, we will go over how to exchange crypto to Tether and why CoinCannon is the best platform to do the job.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why Exchange Crypto to Tether?</strong></h2>



<p>Generally speaking, exchanging assets to Tether is for times when you want to pay less commission and be ready for the next purchase. When you <a href="https://blog.hi.exchange/exchange-cryptocurrency-to-paypal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exchange cryptocurrency to PayPal</a>, the cost for the exchange is considerably higher and it takes a longer time to have the assets in your account. On top of that, the next time you want to buy cryptocurrencies, you will once again have to pay high commission and wait longer. With Tether, the transactions are almost immediate and have a very low cost of transaction.</p>



<p>Comparatively, Tether is good for those who are actively monitoring the market to make their next move. Thankfully, numerous Forex platforms also accept Tether as payment so it has even more utility. On the other hand, PayPal is generally a safer method to store assets with much more regulations.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is Tether (USDT)?</strong></h2>



<p>&nbsp;Before reading about how to exchange crypto to Tether (USDT), let’s take a quick look at what Tether is and how it operates. Tether is a cryptocurrency based on blockchain whose crypto coins in use are backed by an equivalent amount of traditional fiat currencies, such as the Dollar, Euro, or Japanese Yen that is retained in a specific bank account. The Tether tokens, the Tether network’s native tokens, trade under the USDT symbol.</p>



<p>In contrast to the wide swings observed in the prices of other popular cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, Tether belongs to a new race of cryptocurrencies called stablecoins that aims to keep cryptocurrency valuations stable. Instead of being used as a means of speculative investment, this would allow Tether to be used as a medium of exchange and a mode of storage of value.</p>



<p>Tether was specifically developed to create the necessary CoinCannon between fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies, providing users with stability, transparency, and minimum transaction fees. It is pegged against the US dollar and, in terms of value, maintains a 1-to-1 ratio with USD. There is, however, no guarantee provided by Tether Ltd. for any right to redeem or exchange real money for Tethers, i.e. Tethers cannot be exchanged for U.S. Dollars.</p>
