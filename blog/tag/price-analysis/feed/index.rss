<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Key Points:</strong></h2>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>CEO of CryptoQuant, Ki Young Ju, forecasts Bitcoin&#8217;s price to soar up to $112,000 by the end of 2024, driven by anticipated inflows from Spot ETFs.</li>



<li>A potential monthly inflow of $9.5 billion from ETFs could augment Bitcoin&#8217;s actual value by $114 billion, potentially propelling the price to $112,000.</li>



<li>Ju presents an optimistic projection ranging from $104,000 to $112,000, with a more conservative estimate between $55,000 and $59,000.</li>
</ul>



<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-e6322d0116284c915cf7bc8d3aee3c30">In an insightful analysis shared by CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju, Bitcoin is poised for a remarkable ascent to $112,000 in 2024, primarily fueled by the anticipated influx of funds from exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Highlighting the pivotal role of ETF cash inflows, Ju predicts a monthly surge of $9.5 billion, augmenting Bitcoin&#8217;s actual capitalization by a staggering $114 billion annually.</p>



<p>Ju&#8217;s forecast paints a bullish picture of Bitcoin&#8217;s trajectory, envisioning a potential surge to $112,000 by the year&#8217;s end. Despite speculation regarding possible exits from Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), Ju remains optimistic about Bitcoin&#8217;s price rally, projecting a substantial increase of $76 billion in accurate capitalization. This could elevate Bitcoin&#8217;s current capitalization from $451 billion to between $527 billion and $565 billion.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="655" height="789" src="https://hi.exchange/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/فاببتع-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-8212" srcset="https://hi.exchange/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/فاببتع-1.png 655w, https://hi.exchange/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/فاببتع-1-249x300.png 249w" sizes="(max-width: 655px) 100vw, 655px" /></figure></div>


<p>Ju remains confident in Bitcoin&#8217;s resilience despite potential fluctuations, foreseeing a price range between $104,000 and $112,000 fueled by ETF inflows. Even in a more conservative scenario, Bitcoin could still maintain a strong position, trading between $55,000 and $59,000.</p>



<p>Amidst this anticipation, Bitcoin is already displaying signs of momentum, with its current weekly candle reflecting a gain of 12.58%. Trading above $48,000, Bitcoin&#8217;s volume in the last 24 hours has surged to $20.65 billion, hinting at growing investor interest and market activity.</p>

<p>Lark Davis &#8211; the well-known audacious researcher and forecaster of renowned digital currency analysts &#8211; ecstatic digital currency enthusiasts and investors regarding his prediction of Ethereum in 2024.</p>



<p>In his most recent YouTube video, Davis dug into the untapped potential of Ethereum and insisted that crypto bases are the way to get rich with Ethereum. However, this is by no means an easy or straightforward path.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe title="Ethereum Will Make Millionaires In 2024, BUT Not How You Think" width="800" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dYiBe72ww6k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Ethereum price path in 2024</h2>



<p>According to Davis, Ethereum can reach $10,000 to $15,000. He emphasizes that simply buying and holding Ethereum is not a golden ticket to wealth. At Ethereum&#8217;s current price of $2,295, investors are likely to see a 600% return, which is very remarkable. But Davis points to more lucrative opportunities.</p>



<p>There are fundamental financial changes in Ethereum layer two solutions. Networks built on top of Ethereum to increase its scalability and efficiency. He emphasizes that these layer two platforms, such as StarkNet, ZK Sync, and others, are much more than Ethereum. They cause the explosive growth of the price of this currency.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Prospects for 2024 Ethereum price growth</h2>



<p>According to Davis, these Layer 2 networks should be monitored for new token listings. He mentions Celestia as an example, which witnessed a 500% gain just one month after going public. Keeping an eye on these new listings can be significant for people hoping to make substantial earnings rapidly.</p>



<p>Davis also highlights the possibility of airdrops in the Layer 2 space. He shares details on how to take part in these airdrops by chain activities and staking, such as the Manta Network and zkSync programs. Compared to conventional ETH investments, these airdrops have the potential to be more profitable, more immediate, and generate greater returns.</p>



<p>The value of the largest altcoin was $2,295 at the time of publication. A few analysts expect it to increase to $2,500 in the final five days of the year. The weekly and daily charts for Ethereum are currently showing green, and the Fear and Greed indicator is shifting in favor of Greed, indicating strong bullishness. Furthermore, Ether is anticipated to be among the leaders of the anticipated uptrend in 2024.</p>

<p>Despite the most recent changes regarding the Bitcoin ETF, the landscape of virtual currencies is once more in the midst of a profound shift. The most valuable cryptocurrency in the world of digital assets, Bitcoin, has recently declined, losing more than 2.4% of its value.</p>



<p>This year has witnessed a stunning <strong>156% acquisition</strong> in the value of the most popular digital currency, Bitcoin. The primary cause for these changes is the conjecture that the launch of ETFs could generate a new wave of demand. Undoubtedly, not all of this can be considered entirely beneficial because there is a lot of speculation in the market on whether or not the approval of these ETFs would lead to profit-taking strategies. Such speculation can potentially negatively impact the shifts in the value of bitcoin.</p>



<p><strong>CryptoQuant</strong> described what happened as a possible<em> <strong>&#8220;sell the news&#8221;</strong></em> incident, referring to the wave that formed upon the news.</p>



<p>The term used above refers to a well-known phenomenon in the capital markets: the rising sentiment, leverage, and asset prices before a positive event, followed by a sharp decline in prices.</p>



<p>This is because smart traders take advantage of overloaded long deals, ensnaring leveraged traders and pressuring them to sell out or liquidate during drops.</p>



<p>The announcement that an ETF for Bitcoin is being approved can be seen as beneficial since it allows institutions to start investing in the cryptocurrency, increasing buying pressure.</p>



<p>The memo stated that &#8220;Bitcoin short holders are experiencing an unrealistic 30% profit margin, which has historically been before price corrections (areas marked with red circles).&#8221; Furthermore, short-term holders keep spending Bitcoin profitably, and returns typically materialize once short-term losses are realized.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h2>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">ETF Approval: What to Expect from Bitcoin?</h1>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Bitcoin has recently declined, losing 2.4% of its value, and is currently trading at $42,400</li>



<li>2023 has witnessed a stunning 156% acquisition in Bitcoin&#8217;s value</li>



<li>The main cause of this decline can be the conjecture of the launch of ETFs and the newly generated wave of demand.</li>



<li>Bitcoin short holders are experiencing an unrealistic 30% profit margin.</li>



<li>CryptoQuant described what happened as a possible &#8220;sell the news&#8221; incident, referring to the wave that formed upon the news.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Finally, we all lived the day to see a crypto market rally pulling underwater investors out of a year-long slump. Subsequently, BTC moved up from the $17k channel and is currently trading at $23k. with that, altcoins did what altcoins do best that is to follow Bitcoin without any sort of autonomy. However, recent statistics from CoinShares have revealed a fascinating insight as to what is going on behind the crypto market rally. From a conflict in opinion in different regions to high amount of weekly inflows used to short crypto assets, circumstances in crypto market have divided the investor sentiment. Let’s take a closer look.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Learn <a href="https://hi.exchange/blog/exchange-cryptocurrency-to-paypal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How to Exchange Cryptocurrency to PayPal</a></p></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Not Your Average Crypto Market Rally</strong></h2>



<p>Essentially, the wild rallies back in 2020 and 2021 had a pretty straightforward structure. The overall outlook toward crypto was bullish while institutional investors made huge purchases for the long run. In the meantime, retail investors were more inclined toward hodling.</p>



<p>Following the embarrassing collapse of <a href="https://hi.exchange/blog/terra-2-0-launch/v" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">terra (LUNA)</a> and the horrible annihilation of <a href="https://hi.exchange/blog/ftx-collapse/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FTX</a>, both the institutional and retail investors have lost faith in the crypto. With that, it seems that the majority of bullish investors at the moment are traders who aren’t necessarily committing to long-term ventures.</p>



<p>In the latest Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report, <a href="https://blog.coinshares.com/volume-115-digital-asset-fund-flows-weekly-report-c7cd25f806ea" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CoinShares</a> finds that trading activity is suspiciously higher than usual.</p>



<p>“Trading activity for the week was high at US$1.6bn, above the 90-day average of US$990m, with 80% of the trading focused on Bitcoin.”</p>



<p>Despite that gargantuan number, most of the weekly inflow went on to back short BTC products. Fundamentally, these products profit on downward moves of Bitcoin. In total short BTC products had over $25.5 million in inflows last week which is almost five times higher than what traditional BTC products had in inflows that is $5.7 million.</p>



<p>&nbsp;“Digital asset investment products saw US$37m inflows last week, although this was predominantly into short investment products (68%).”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://hi.exchange/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Recent-Crypto-Market-Rally-Divisive-and-Hopeful-1024x725.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-6295" /></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-regionally-divided"><strong>Regionally Divided</strong></h2>



<p>Basically, CoinShare data reveals that North American institutions are predominantly making the short moves on BTC. At the moment, the sentiment on Bitcoin and other crypto assets are radically different on both sides of the Atlantis.</p>



<p>“Regionally, opinion is very polarised. Inflows were seen in Europe, most notably Germany and Switzerland with US$14m and US$10m respectively. Outflows were seen in European short investment products too, suggesting sentiment is positive. In contrast, Hong Kong saw outflows from long investment products (US$11m), while the 95% of the inflows into the US were into short-Bitcoin products.”</p>



<p>At this point, there’s still not enough evidence to prove that the recent crypto market rally is a bull trap. Regardless, the data is consistently indicating a massive divide in sentiment and of course a huge amount of interest in trading rather than holding. With all that, it would be safe to assume that the crypto market will likely become highly volatile for at least the first quarter of 2023. So hang in tight, and get onboard the emotional roller coaster of crypto investment!</p>

<p>Once again, Bitcoin price failed to surpass $20,000. It is likely for BTC to have another correction. However, the $18,900 support Is currently too strong. Here is a summary of Bitcoin price in the past 24 hours:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><a href="/Users/Admin/Desktop/Work/Coinbase%20Exchange%20Sold%20User%20Data%20to%20ICE%20(Shocking)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Exchange Bitcoin to PayPal</a> on CoinCannon</p></blockquote></figure>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Bitcoin price failed to break through $20,000.</li><li>Currently, the price is below $19,400 and the 1-hour candles are below the SMA100.</li><li>On the 1-hour chart, we see a new downtrend forming with resistance at $19,250.</li><li>BTC is likely to move toward $18,900 in short-term.</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bitcoin Price Action Analysis</strong></h2>



<p>With a recovery, Bitcoin managed to move above $19,500 and at some point reached $19,800. However, the sellers took control and pushed BTC down. With that, BTC climbed only as high as $19,939 and then had a correction.</p>



<p>Subsequently, the price lost the $19,500 and $19,400. The sellers brought BTC down below the 50% Fibonacci retracement level from the latest rally from $18,271 to $19,939. At the moment, BTC is trading below $19,400 and the 1-hour candles are below the SMA100. On the 1-hour chart, we see a new downtrend forming with resistance at $19,250.</p>



<p>The $19,220 is the first resistance for BTC followed closely by $19,250. Breaking through this level can pump BTC back above $19,500. Despite that, the primary resistance is still the $20,000. Further growth can push the price all the way up to $21,200.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if Bitcoin price fails to surpass $19,250, the correction will continue. In which case, the $19,000 is a key support level followed closely by $18,900. This level is close to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level from the latest rise. Dipping below $18,900 can increase the selling pressure and bring BTC down to $18,500.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Technical Indicators</strong></h2>



<p>MACD indicator: at the time of writing this article the 1-hour MACD indicator for BTC is on a downward momentum.</p>



<p>RSI: the 1-hour relative strength index is currently at 50.</p>



<p>Resistance levels: Right now, the $19,250, $20,000 and $20,500 are crucial resistance levels for BTC.</p>



<p>Support levels: The $18,900 is currently the key support level for the price.</p>

<p>Bitcoin price is consolidating above $19,200. In case BTC manages to surpass $19,700, it could form a new rally. Here is a summary of Bitcoin price in the past 24 hours:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><mark style="background-color:#ffffff" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color"><a href="/Users/Admin/Desktop/Work/Coinbase%20Exchange%20Sold%20User%20Data%20to%20ICE%20(Shocking)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Exchange Bitcoin to PayPal</a> on CoinCannon</mark></p></blockquote></figure>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>BTC is facing resistance at $19,550 and $19,600.</li><li>Currently, the price is below $20,000 and the 1-hour candles are below the SMA100.</li><li>On the 1-hour chart, we see BTC moving above a downtrend at $19,450.</li><li>In case Bitcoin surpasses $19,700, there could be a new rally to follow.</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bitcoin Price Action Analysis</strong></h2>



<p>BTC took a downturn at $20,200 and moved below critical support levels at $20,000 and $19,800. Furthermore, the sellers took Bitcoin down below $19,500 and the SMA100. The lowest recorded price in the past few hours has been $19,249 before having a minor recovery. With that, BTC took back $19,500 and broke through the $19,450 which is on a downtrend on the 1-hour chart. Subsequently, the price touched the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level from the latest all from $20,443 to $19,249. Currently, BTC is trading below $20,000 and the 1-hour candles are below the SMA100.</p>



<p>The fist resistance level for BTC is at $19,550 followed by $19,700 on the SMA100. Closing above$19,700 can bring the price closer to 50% Fibonacci which is very bullish. In which case, the price could quickly approach $20,000 and then regain $20,500.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if Bitcoin price fails to surpass $19,700, the downtrend will continue. For this scenario, the $19,400 is the first support followed by $19,250. Dipping below $19,250 can bring Bitcoin down to $18,500 support.</p>

At that point, Cardano faced strong resistance and had a correction. Subsequently, the price fell down to $0.4150 and found support. By stabilizing, Cardano made another move and climbed up to $0.4350 but failed to break through. Currently, ADA price is around $0.4220.</p>

<p>At this point, the $0.4150 is the first support level for Cardano. In case of good support, the price can one again make an attempt to surpass the downtrend on the chart. For that, the $0.4250 is the level to beat followed by $0.43 on the SMA100. The $0.4350 and $0.44 are the next resistance levels to follow.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if ADA price fails to surpass $0.43, there could be further correction. For the bearish scenario, the $0.42 and $0.4150 are key support levels. In case of losing them, the $0.40 and $0.38 are the following support levels.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bitcoin Price Action Analysis</strong></h2>



<p>Bitcoin price stabilized below $19,000 and lost the $18,500 support then reached a low of $18,223. Despite that, it did not test the $18,000 support since the buyers rose to support it.</p>



<p>Subsequently, BTC took back $18,500 and $18,800. Then, it moved above the 50% Fibonacci retracement level from the latest fall from $20,198 to $18,223. It even had a spike up to $19,500 but once again the sellers took back control on the SMA100. On the 1-hour chart, we see a new downtrend forming with resistance at $19,650. This level is right on the 76.4% Fibonacci retracement level from the latest dip.</p>



<p>The $19,600 is the first resistance level for Bitcoin followed by the key level at $20,000. Further growth can push BTC up to $20,500. Furthermore, if the buyers remain strong, BTC can touch $21,200.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if Bitcoin price fails to surpass $19,600, there could be a new downtrend. In which case, the $19,200 will be the first support level followed by $18,850. Losing the $18,850 and $18,500 can bring the price down to $18,223 and lower.</p>

<p>ADA price fell down to $0.43 and $0.4250 on August 29 and had support before going further down. With that, Cardano managed to stabilize at this level and go for a recovery attempt. Subsequently, the price managed to surpass $0.45 and $0.50 and reach $0.53 by September 10. At that point, ADA faced strong resistance and despite multiple attempts, failed to break through. Therefore, it fell down to $0.46 with a correction. Currently, ADA price is at $0.49.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>ADA Price Action Analysis</strong></h2>



<p>Taking a look at the 4-hour chart, we see Cardano hitting a resistance at $0.60 and having to back down. By losing the $0.50, the price fell down to $0.4250 but had support at this level. With a recovery, Cardano climbed as high as $0.53 on September 10 but faced resistance. After that, it settled back down at $0.4550.</p>

<p>BNB price faced strong resistance at $340 and had to back down. By losing the $300 and $275, Binance Coin fell down to $260 on September 6 but found support. With that, it had a chance to recover and managed to surpass $275 and $285 to reach $300. At that point, it hit a downtrend and had to once again back down to $275. Currently, BNB price is at $280.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><mark style="background-color:#ffffff" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">Exchange Binance Coin (BNB) to PayPal instantly on <a href="http://www.hi.exchange" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jolixo</a></mark></p></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>BNB Price Action Analysis</strong></h2>



<p>Taking a look at the 4-hour chart, we see BNB hitting a dead end at $340 and having to back down with a downward channel. Following that, the price continued ranging between the top and bottom and hit the bottom at $260. Subsequently, BNB managed to bounce back and recover. Binance coin surpassed $275 and $285 and peaked at $300 on September 12. Once again, the price turned back down after touching the ceiling and fell down to $275.</p>



<p>At the moment, the $275 is the first support level for BNB. In case of successful support, we expect Binance coin to continue upwards. For the bullish scenario, the $285 and then 295 on the SMA100 are the first resistance levels for the price. In case BNB breaks through the top of the channel, it could reach $300 and $310.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if BNB price fails to surpass $285 and loses the $275, further correction will follow. In which case, the $270 and $260 are the next support levels. Further decline can bring BNB as low as $250 and $240.</p>

<p>Bitcoin price is hovering above $22,000 level in the green zone. In case BTC surpassed $22,500, it could potentially form a new rally. Here is a summary of Bitcoin price in the past 24 hours:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><mark style="background-color:#ffffff" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color"><a href="/Users/Admin/Desktop/Work/Coinbase%20Exchange%20Sold%20User%20Data%20to%20ICE%20(Shocking)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Exchange Bitcoin to PayPal</a> on CoinCannon</mark></p></blockquote></figure>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Bitcoin has stabilized above $21,500 and $22,000.</li><li>Currently, the price is above $22,000 and the 1-hour candles are above the SMA100.</li><li>On the 1-hour chart, we see a new uptrend forming with support level at $21,800.</li><li>At the moment, BTC is having a slight correction and could likely form a new rally at above $22,500.</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bitcoin Price Action Analysis</strong></h2>



<p>BTC could finally surpass $21,500 and $22,000 levels with the support coming from buyers. With that, the price stabilized above $22,000 and the SMA100. Subsequently, Bitcoin price reached a high of $22,473 and went for a correction. Consequently, BTC dipped below $22,200 and penetrated below the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level from the latest growth from $21,180 to $22,473. Currently, the price is above $22,000 and the 1-hour candles are above the SMA100. On the 1-hour chart, we see a new uptrend forming with support at $21,800.</p>



<p>The first resistance for BTC is at $22,450 followed closely by $22,500. Breaking through $22,500 will likely cause further growth. In which case, the $23,200 will be the next resistance level and would pave the way to reach $24,000.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if Bitcoin price fails to surpass $22,500, there could be further correction ahead. For this scenario, the $22,000 will be the first support level followed by $21,800. This level is near the 50% Fibonacci retracement level from the latest rise. Dipping below $21,500 can push BTC further down to $21,000.</p>
