<p>Here’s the easiest way to exchange BNB to USDT instantly with full anonymity! Binance Coin (BNB) is one of the top crypto assets by market cap. For the most part, this popularity stem’s from Binance’s massive scale as an exchange platform. Now, while users can easily exchange BNB to USDT on Binance platform, they will have to compromise on their privacy to do the job. Primarily, Binance requires a much stricter KYC process to authenticate users. On top of that, they will have to comply with multiple governments and share user data with the authorities. Fortunately, CoinCannon cuts down all complications by offering a truly hassle-free KYC process. Furthermore, privacy will not come as a luxury sine CoinCannon offer the lowest exchange fees. With all that, here is a full guide on how to exchange Binance Coin to Tether USDT in only a matter of minutes.</p>



<p>So, head over to <a href="http://www.hi.exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jolixo</a>, choose Binance Coin (BNB) on the left field and Tether (USDT) on the right one and start your exchange.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Learn <a href="https://hi.exchange/blog/exchange-cryptocurrency-to-paypal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How to Exchange Cryptocurrency to PayPal</a></p></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What Do I Need to Exchange BNB to USDT?</strong></h2>



<p>For this exchange, you will need a crypto wallet to receive USDT. Most likely, your Cardano wallet supports USDT, so you can also receive funds in the same wallet. Make sure that you are using a reliable crypto wallet to hold your assets. On the other hand, for CoinCannon platform, all you need is an email address. CoinCannon does not require KYC (know your customer) or sign up. However, there are benefits and rewards for those who <a href="https://hi.exchange/blog/reasosn-sign-up-jolixo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sign up on CoinCannon</a>. How do you like winning $100 gifts ever single month?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is Binance Coin (BNB)?</strong></h2>



<p>Before we go over how to exchange BNB to USDT, let’s go over a brief introduction on Binance Coin. Initially found in China, Binance began as an online cryptocurrency exchange with a strong emphasis on altcoin trading. It didn’t take long for Binance to be crowned as the number one exchange in the world. Amongst the numerous motivating factors and reasons for this profound success, the primary one was high liquidity, low transaction fees and additional discounts for users who made payments by its native coin, BNB. The massive platform has a staggering capacity to process approximately 1.4 million orders per second, offering trading for more than 500 cryptocurrencies and virtual tokens.</p>



<p>As for trading, Binance offers seven trade orders of Limit order, Market order, stop limit order, stop market order, Trailing stop order, Post only order and Limit TP/SL order. Despite the varying transaction fees for withdrawal based on the currency and its amount, there is no transaction fee for deposits.</p>



<p>Initially introduced as an ERC20 Ethereum based cryptocurrency in 2017, BNB has now moved on to Binance’s own blockchain named Binance chain. As the native coin for Binance exchange, BNB was primarily a utility token to motivate users for transaction fee discounts. However, the applications for Binance coin have now expanded dramatically since you can now use Binance Coin for financial services, entertainment, online services and many more.</p>



<p>With all this development happening in a short time period, the 26,500% overall price increase (correct as of January 2022) since being introduced in 2017 is well justified. As of June 4th 2021 BNB has a market cap of $53.7 billion dollars and is only ranked behind Bitcoin and Ethereum.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why Exchange BNB to USDT?</strong></h2>



<p>At this point, it’s good to briefly introduce Tether. Tether is a cryptocurrency based on blockchain whose crypto coins in use are backed by an equivalent amount of traditional fiat currencies, such as the Dollar, Euro, or Japanese Yen that is retained in a specific bank account. The Tether tokens, the Tether network’s native tokens, trade under the USDT symbol.</p>



<p>In contrast to the wide swings observed in the prices of other popular cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, Tether belongs to a new race of cryptocurrencies called stablecoins that aims to keep cryptocurrency valuations stable. Instead of being used as a means of speculative investment, this would allow Tether to be used as a medium of exchange and a mode of storage of value.</p>



<p>Tether was specifically developed to create the necessary CoinCannon between fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies, providing users with stability, transparency, and minimum transaction fees. It is pegged against the US dollar and, in terms of value, maintains a 1-to-1 ratio with USD. There is, however, no guarantee provided by Tether Ltd. for any right to redeem or exchange real money for Tethers, i.e. Tethers cannot be exchanged for U.S. Dollars.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>CoinCannon Platform</strong></h2>



<p>Say goodbye to the hassle of searching for the perfect online exchange. CoinCannon is here to offer you everything you need and more. With a combination of anonymity, unbeatable exchange rates, and reliability, it’s a platform like no other.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Mazars Group, an international audit, tax and advisory firm has suspended all proof-of-reserve work for crypto clients. Consequently, this comes at a time when some of their biggest clients like <a href="https://blog.hi.exchange/binance-exchange-outflows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Binance</a> and <a href="https://blog.hi.exchange/crypto-com-collapse/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crypto.com</a> are facing a massive threat. As to why, their reasoning is beyond condescending and as to why now, their timing is immaculately idiotic. So, before we go further into details and stuff, here’s why they stopped working with crypto clients. In short, they are “concerned” that the public may not fully understand the reports they create. Just wow! Is it not your job as an auditor to create a report that they public easily understands? Are the investors not smart enough to understand Mazars Group reports but are constantly encouraged to invest in their clients? Subsequently, the clients are now pulling out from centralized platforms like Binance. Speaking of Binance, the withdrawals still continue and at the moment they have had over $6 billion.</p>



<p>In the meantime, the Mazars kerfuffle has already reversed the timidly bullish trend in the past week. The decision to leave crypto has spread fear in the market and bumped up the withdrawals across the board. And you know what happens when a sudden wave of withdrawals hit sketchy exchanges right?</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Learn How to<a href="https://blog.hi.exchange/exchange-cryptocurrency-to-paypal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Exchange Cryptocurrency to PayPal</a></p></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Mazars Group FUD</strong></h2>



<p>As part of a report, Binance hired the French auditing firm Mazars group last month. This was an attempt from Binance to reassure customers about their reserves following rumors of insufficient reserves. However, Mazars has now politely left the crypto sector citing various complications in making a report.</p>



<p>Basically, an auditing firm would conduct proof-of-reserve checks. These audits would then confirm that the exchange’s reserve matched the clients’ assets. As it turns out, a massive exchange platform like Binance is pretty much impossible to audit.</p>



<p>“Mazars has paused its activity relating to the provision of ‘Proof of Reserves Reports’ for entities in the cryptocurrency sector due to concerns regarding the way these reports are understood by the public.” Stated the auditor.</p>



<p>However, they threw a curveball at Binance before pausing their services. According to the firm, Binance had overcollateralized their assets. This is something that Kraken CEO had pointed out before.<br><a href="https://twitter.com/jespow/status/1601785215646461952">https://twitter.com/jespow/status/1601785215646461952</a></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-outflows"><strong>The Outflows</strong></h2>



<p>Naturally, the market did not respond well to this news as it resulted hundreds of millions in liquidations. According to <a href="https://www.coinglass.com/LiquidationData" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coinglass</a>, the 24-H total in liquidations exceeds $236 million. At the time of writing this article, BTC is trading at $16,729. Standing tall on top of the liquidations, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, BNB and Litecoin are the unlucky coins.</p>



<p>As it seems, Binance and crypto.com are about to face a continuous wave of heavy withdrawals. A few days ago, Changpeng Zhao, the CEO of Binance called the withdrawals a “stress test” that proves on how good they can handle pressure. At this point, all we can do is hope that these platforms do not shatter under the stress test. In such case, the crypto winter may very well turn into an ice age of epic proportion.</p>

<p>Looking to exchange AdvCash to Binance Coin? <a href="http://www.hi.exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jolixo</a> is the best platform for the job. AdvCash has arguably been gaining lots of traction as a payment method. This doesn’t come as a surprise since it offers excellent diversity and very low fees. However, it is almost crucial to use a mediator in order to buy and sell AdvCash. Finding a third party exchanger is always a big hassle because it is not easy to trust a new platform. Fortunately, CoinCannon provides everything you need including no added fees, no KYC and of course competitive exchange rates. In this article, we will go over everything you need to exchange AdvCash to Binance Coin.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Learn How to <a href="https://blog.hi.exchange/exchange-advcash-to-paypal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Exchange AdvCash to PayPal</a></p></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What Do I Need to Exchange AdvCash to Binance Coin?</strong></h2>



<p>For this transaction, you will need a verified and active AdvCash account. Make sure that the transaction amount does not exceed your withdrawal limit. Furthermore, you need a reliable crypto wallet to receive Binance Coin (BNB). As for CoinCannon, all you need is an email-address since no KYC (know your customer) is necessary. However, bear in mind that there are many advantages available for those who sign up on CoinCannon. Want a good reason why? How about winning $100 every month!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is AdvCash?</strong></h2>



<p>AdvCash is a currency used for online payments. It is based in Belize which provides immunity from national laws of other countries for it. As an offshore currency, it is also encrypted much like cryptocurrencies and benefits from better anonymity and security. The Advance Cash company provides an account for users that allows for a variety of currencies to operate through it. In many ways, it is a lot like Payeer.</p>



<p>And much like Payeer, AdvCash supports transfers in both fiat and cryptocurrency form. With a virtual wallet, users can transfer funds and make payments with very low commission. What makes it interesting, is that Advance Cash is also compatible with other payment systems such as WebMoney or Perfect Money. With free international transfers, users get to enjoy a wide variety of currencies all in a virtual wallet. Furthermore, there are both physical and virtual bank cards available for quick and cheap international Visa/Mastercard payments.</p>



<p>The company was founded in 2014 as a competitor for PayPal and much like its peers, it has gained notable success in the past few years. As the need for virtual banking grows, online payment processing companies continue to narrow the gap with PayPal. Although, such companies are not as popular as PayPal, they offer a lot more freedom.</p>

<p>Upon hearing crypto Twitter, one shall be overwhelmed by the traumatic images of the meme wars. A safe haven for those with bold predictions of both bullish and bearish nature, fortune tellers perhaps. It used to be glamorous, back in the bullish days of our past, it used to be busy. And you can’t deny, there was something special about crypto Twitter, a community of endless bots. Busy streets paved with statements, technical analysis, shilling attempts, NFT sellers, crypto beggars. For that, one may call it a slum, with a handful of slumlords like Elon and CZ running a show. Elon’s acquisition of Twitter is surely a breath of fresh air for the crypto Twitter community. A community of investors bashed by a long-term bear market. And in his reign, other slumlords are now joining to help.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Learn How to <a href="https://blog.hi.exchange/exchange-cryptocurrency-to-paypal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Exchange Cryptocurrency to PayPal</a></p></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Numbers Go Up!</strong></h2>



<p>Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange is rushing to chip in the crypto Twitter. Reportedly, Binance is making a team to help Elon incorporate blockchain technology into Twitter’s business model.</p>



<p>For the most part, integrating crypto into Twitter will take some work. With that, Binance’s team will be boots on the ground in Twitter HQ to help the free bird. This is according to a recent report by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/crypto-exchange-binance-musks-co-investor-help-twitter-with-blockchain-2022-10-28/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reuters</a>.</p>



<p>While Jack Dorsey, the previous owner of Twitter is planning to develop web5, CZ and Elon will rely on web3 to handle problems. Based on the report, the new Binance team will look toward crypto-based solutions to tackle Twitter issues. At this point, it would be safe to say that even the Binance team doesn’t know exactly what that means. However, one thing is for certain and that is the fact that crypto Twitter is here to pump the bejesus out of crypto.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>All Aboard Crypto Twitter</strong></h2>



<p>Last week, Elon finally managed to make the deal and purchase Twitter for $44 billion. He let that sink in Twitter HQ and fired a whole bunch of top executives.</p>



<p>Previously, Binance had made a pledge to co-invest with Elon back in May. According to Binance, Musk’s leadership could help utilize the web potential and its integration with social media. Furthermore, they expressed their hopefulness for an accelerated adoption rate for crypto assets in such case.</p>



<p>Changpeng Zhao, the CEO of Binance <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1585836479129202688?t=qefpBd450uBr68Sy0BaaSw&amp;s=19">told</a> his followers on Twitter (probably mostly bots) that the money was wired a few days ago.</p>



<p>“Our intern says we wired the $500 million two days ago, probably just as I was being asked about Elon/Twitter.”</p>



<p>Binance was in fact quick to jump on the Crypto Twitter train with a considerable investment.</p>

<p>BNB price faced strong resistance at $340 and had to back down. By losing the $300 and $275, Binance Coin fell down to $260 on September 6 but found support. With that, it had a chance to recover and managed to surpass $275 and $285 to reach $300. At that point, it hit a downtrend and had to once again back down to $275. Currently, BNB price is at $280.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>BNB Price Action Analysis</strong></h2>



<p>Taking a look at the 4-hour chart, we see BNB hitting a dead end at $340 and having to back down with a downward channel. Following that, the price continued ranging between the top and bottom and hit the bottom at $260. Subsequently, BNB managed to bounce back and recover. Binance coin surpassed $275 and $285 and peaked at $300 on September 12. Once again, the price turned back down after touching the ceiling and fell down to $275.</p>



<p>At the moment, the $275 is the first support level for BNB. In case of successful support, we expect Binance coin to continue upwards. For the bullish scenario, the $285 and then 295 on the SMA100 are the first resistance levels for the price. In case BNB breaks through the top of the channel, it could reach $300 and $310.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if BNB price fails to surpass $285 and loses the $275, further correction will follow. In which case, the $270 and $260 are the next support levels. Further decline can bring BNB as low as $250 and $240.</p>

<p>BNB price failed to surpass $340 on August 11 and had to back down. Subsequently, it lost the $315, $305 and $300 levels and fell down to $280 on August 20. At that point, the price found support on the uptrend and managed to bounce back. With that, Binance coin had a chance for recovery and climbed all the way up to $305 but faced strong resistance. Once again, BNB price had a correction and is currently trading at $295.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><mark style="background-color:#ffffff" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">Exchange Binance Coin (BNB) to PayPal instantly on <a href="http://www.hi.exchange" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jolixo</a></mark></p></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>BNB Price Action Analysis</strong></h2>



<p>Taking a look at the 4-hour chart, we see BNB riding on an uptrend in the long-term. Characteristically, the price reached a top of $340 on August 11 but failed to surpass this level and faced a correction. At that point, BNB fell down to $275 and had support at the uptrend. Therefore, it set to recover but had to halt by reaching the 50% Fibonacci retracement level. Currently, BNB is trading at $295.</p>



<p>For the moment, the $295 on the SMA100 is the key support level for Binance coin. In case of providing sufficient support, we can expect further growth in short-term. For the bullish scenario, the $305 will be the first resistance level. After that, the $320 and $340 will be next in line. In case of a successful break through from $340, we can expect $260 and $380 to follow.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if BNB price fails to surpass $305 and subsequently loses the $295, further decline will follow. In which case, the long-term uptrend is expected to support BNB at $275. Losing this level would bring Binance coin as low as $240.</p>

<p>BNB price had support at $190 on June 19<sup>th</sup> and bounced back with an upwards channel. With that, the price continued on ranging between the top and bottom. On July 26, BNB found support at the bottom of the channel at $240. Subsequently, Binance Coin surpassed $255 resistance level and the SMA100. After that, it managed to break through $275 and reached $300 yesterday. At that point, BNB price hit the top of the channel at and fell down to $275.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>BNB Price Action Analysis</strong></h2>



<p>Taking a look at the 4-hour chart, we see BNB price having support at $185 on June and moving within an upward channel. Yesterday, Binance Coin peaked all the way up to $320 yet failed to surpass this level.</p>



<p>For now, the $305 level near the SMA100 is the first support level for BNB price. In case of a successful support, Binance Coin can continue the bullish trend. For the bullish scenario, the $325 is the first resistance level followed by $340. Following that, the $350 and $370 are the next key resistance levels for the price. Breaking them would pave the way to regain the $400 level.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if BNB price fails to surpass $320 and subsequently loses the $300 level, there could be further correction to follow.</p>



<p>For the bearish scenario, the $290 will be the next support level. In case of losing this level, the $270 will be next to support Binance Coin.</p>

<p>Taking a look at the 4-hour chart, we see BNB price finding support at $330 and turning green. Following that, the price bounced back and surpassed the $365 resistance level and peaked at $385.</p>



<p>Currently, the $375 is the first support level for Binance Coin which could eventually push BNB to retest $385. In case of a successful break through, the next resistance level will be at $400 which is a key level. After that, we can expect $410 to be the next resistance level.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if BNB price fails to surpass $380 and subsequently lose the $370 level, further correction will follow.</p>



<p>For the bearish scenario, the $360 near the SMA100 and 50% Fibonacci retracement level will be the key support level. Further decline can bring Binance Coin as low as $340.</p>

<p>BNB price hit a barrier at $435 last week and had to back down. Following that, the price lost the $420, $410 and $400 support levels and settled on $375. Subsequently, BNB finally found support at that point and did not have further decline. Therefore, it started a recover process. Currently, BNB Price is around $390.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>BNB Price Action Analysis</strong></h2>



<p>Taking a look at the 4-hour chart, we see BNB had a rejection from the trendline at $430 and had a sharp plunge at almost 10%. By losing the key support level at $400, BNB fell as low as $375 before finally having support from the buyers and an attempt for recovery.</p>



<p>Today, after surpassing the $380, BNB started a new uptrend and is currently facing the $390 resistance level. In case of a successful break through, the next resistance levels are at $400, the SMA100 and the 50% Fibonacci retracement level. By surpassing this key level, the next resistance level is at $420.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if BNB fails to surpass $390 and $400, there could be further price correction to follow. For the bearish scenario, the $380 is the first support level. In case of losing this crucial level, the next stop will be at $360 while further decline can bring the price down to $340.</p>

<p>Got publicity? Binance exchange is now literally buying Forbes’s integrity with a $200 million deal. After all, it is quite necessary for a giant like Binance Exchange to maintain good publicity. And the obvious answer to that is to pay a few hundred million achieved from questionable ICOs to buy into a troubled media company. Officially called as a “strategic investment”, it is more of an ambitious business venture for both parties. So, if you’re a fan of ranking articles on Forbes, expect a lot of rankings with Binance exchange on top!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">Buy and Sell Cryptocurrencies instantly with the lowest exchange fees on <a href="http://www.hi.exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jolixo</a>.</span></p></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Top 10 Nice Things about Binance Exchange</strong></h2>



<p>In a recent announcement, Forbes <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220210005573/en/Forbes-Announces-200-Million-Strategic-Investment-from-Binance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated</a> that Binance exchange will be investing $200 million into the media company. According to both sides, the investment aims to provide more accurate and professional information about blockchain technology. In simple terms, Forbes will take advantage of Binance’s expertise while Binance kindly attempts to educate the masses about blockchain, Web3 and cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p>Both Forbes and Binance spoke about this announcement. Forbes CEO Mike Federle spoke on the latest announcement,</p>



<p>“Forbes is committed to demystifying the complexities and providing helpful information about blockchain technologies and all emerging digital assets.</p>



<p>With Binance’s investment in Forbes, we now have the experience, network and resources of the world’s leading crypto exchange and one of the world’s most successful blockchain innovators.</p>



<p>Forbes… can become a true leader in the field with their help.”</p>



<p>Here is a fun fact about Forbes, Heather Morgan who is recently charged with stealing $4.5 billion in Bitcoin from Bitfinex is a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/heathermorgan/?sh=1324e2427f7d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forbes contributor</a>. Ironically, she has a piece about cyber security for online exchanges giving them lots of helpful tips.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Expect More</strong></h2>



<p>In the grand scheme of things, every giant entity will seek to sink their claws into the media sector. In that regard, there will be two predominant approaches to control one’s publicity. First, you can start your own media company or news platform which takes time and resources. Or, you can simply do what Binance exchange did and pay a media giant to buy into their good will.</p>



<p>At this point, crypto giants are racing for domination and it was only a matter of time for such investment to happen. Binance has been dealing with negative publicity and a high number of active lawsuits all around the word. This is an attempt to control at least some of the narrative. Subsequently, investments of this nature will most definitely take place when other large exchange apps such as Coinbase, Kraken and Crypto.com will have no choice but to follow.</p>



<p>On the other hand, the crypto market at this point is basically “buy the rumor, sell the news”. Binance paying Forbes $200 million to kindly educate them about NFTs and metaverse is a testament to their attempt in order to control the market further than before. considering the circumstances, the media sector is the next target for Crypto giants.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-buy-binance-coin-bnb-with-perfect-money"><strong>Why Buy Binance Coin (BNB) with Perfect Money?</strong></h2>



<p>Perfect Money is an e-currency for making payments on the internet. It is widely accepted as payment option by countless platforms. With Perfect Money, you can do a lot! Be it transferring funds to others or pay for goods and services. Or how about buying cryptocurrencies or even buying fiat currencies. It is a seriously popular payment method for online users. An additional capability is to loan and receipt issuance throughout the system.</p>



<p>The biggest downside of Perfect Money, however, is that you cannot cash Perfect money to your bank account on its website directly. For that, you will need a platform like CoinCannon to exchange your Perfect Money to PayPal and other e-currencies.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-to-buy-binance-coin-bnb-with-perfect-money"><strong>How to Buy Binance Coin (BNB) with Perfect Money?</strong></h2>



<p>All it takes is 5 easy steps:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Step 1 : Enter the homepage first, then select Perfect Money and Binance Coin from the options in the first step. Enter the amount you want to exchange. Following that, the amount of BNB you will receive will automatically calculate.</li>



<li>Step 2 : Press Exchange and you will go to the next stage where you will enter your BNB wallet details, email, and phone number.</li>



<li>Step 3 : One more time, click on the “Exchange” button and you will go to the next step where you will review your order.</li>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-jolixo-is-better"><strong>CoinCannon is Better!</strong></h2>

<p>The <a href="https://hi.exchange/">jolixo</a> team consists of traders and professionals who have felt the need for an ideal exchange and pursued their vision.</p>



<p>First and foremost, all users need to protect their personal information especially when it comes down to financial transactions. Unfortunately, a vast majority of exchange apps and platforms make massive profits off of selling user data. Best case scenario, they are legally bound to disclose user information with national authorities for any reason. </p>



<p>In that regard, the best method to protect your privacy is to not disclose them with anyone at all. CoinCannon does not require customers to go through KYC (know your customer) or even a mandatory sign up. In that regard, it is simply as safe as one can get making an exchange.</p>



<p>On the other hand, privacy is not a reason to pay more on your exchange. With that in mind, the platform offers some of the most competitive exchange rates you can find anywhere. Don’t take our word for it. You can simply pay a visit to ranking websites such as BestChange or OkChanger and see compare our rates with others.</p>
