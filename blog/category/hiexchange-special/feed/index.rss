<p>In today’s interconnected world, online payments are the heart of global commerce. However, for many users in countries like Russia, Iran, Venezuela, and Cuba, accessing trusted international payment gateways such as PayPal, Visa, and MasterCard remains a significant challenge. These obstacles, often caused by laws, currency restrictions, or regional rules, leave individuals and businesses struggling to complete essential online transactions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Recognizing these difficulties, CoinCannon offers an innovative solution: <a href="https://hi.exchange/En/solutions/online-payment">Online Payment</a>, a service that allows users to avoid traditional barriers and complete payments quickly, securely, and without the need for challenging account setups or verifications.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Here’s our keyword for the day: US dollar collapse! This bold statement seems to be flying around the media like an imminent threat. It’s currently “the” topic of conversation in every podcast, every tweet and every Substack article <a href="https://reason.com/2023/04/10/elon-musk-matt-taibbi-twitter-substack/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">censored by Elon</a>. On the opposite side, China and Russia and their allies are embracing this US dollar collapse conversation with wide open arms. Now, while the BRICS countries are supposedly developing their own currency, this unborn currency has a long road ahead. In this article, we will go over some of the big reasons why the US dollar will not bow down to Chinese Yuan or even Bitcoin. At least not as easy as the media says!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>World Superpower by 2032 (Probably)</strong></h2>



<p>Ironically, you can find thousands of podcast clips on YouTube where you see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzhRWfim8ZE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">former CIA spies</a> explain how and why China will be the top superpower by a decade or something. Of course, they’re very careful with their words and use a lot of “if” and “possibly” and “probably” in their discourse. Of course, we are assuming that this former CIA agent used to be a geopolitical expert in CIA and not just a field agent (sarcasm). Regardless, everyone is talking about how the US economy is about to collapse. Subsequently, the ruthless wave of suggested posts and videos about this topic made me angry last week. So here we are, swimming against the current mostly because it tickles my ego to be the opposing side in every conversation.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Bitcoin Will Kill Fiat (Probably Not) </h3>



<p>On top of that, it’s also critical to talk about cryptocurrencies and whether they will be replacing the US dollar. This one has been a long time coming! Thousands of crypto bros talking about the upcoming US dollar collapse and how Bitcoin will be the next world reserve currency. Once again, all the video suggestions on YouTube where you have a random guy telling me that Bitcoin will be $1,000,000 by 2024 annoyed me beyond belief.  </p>



<p>Ironically, the <a href="https://hi.exchange/blog/tales-from-the-chain-chapter-v-bitcoin-maximalist/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin maximalist</a> community isn’t concerned at all with their terminology. They are certain about their predictions and value their vision just like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manson_Family" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Manson family</a> did! Of course, this article will address Bitcoin and its future implications in detail. But before we do that, let’s just say that altcoins will always be alternative coins to Bitcoin and that’s just what they are forever! So no! I am not interested in your upcoming altcoin airdrop!</p>



<p>At this point, it is worth mentioning that the sole purpose of this article is to address the US dollar collapse topic which does not include a defense for US foreign or domestic policies.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The US Dollar Collapse (Unlikely)</strong></h2>



<p>To address this topic, there are countless factors to consider and thousands of unexpected event that can (possibly) happen. However, there are five primary points to consider before making the final judgement.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>China’s Bond Market </strong></h3>



<p>When it comes to China, although the Chinese economy has grown significantly in recent years, its bond market is still relatively smaller and less developed compared to established reserve currencies like the US dollar, euro, and Japanese yen. According to data from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), as of 2021, the Chinese yuan (CNY) accounted for only around 2% of global foreign exchange reserves, while the US dollar (USD) remained the dominant reserve currency with a share of around 59%. <strong>The Chinese bond market also lacks liquidity and transparency</strong> compared to more mature markets, which can affect its attractiveness as a reserve currency.</p>



<p>Additionally, various factors such as government intervention, capital controls, and regulatory restrictions in China&#8217;s financial markets may also impact the development and internationalization of its bond market, which in turn can affect its potential as a reserve currency. Ultimately, the Chinese bond market does not bring about a lot of investor confidence.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Capital Controls in China</strong></h3>



<p>Capital controls refer to restrictions imposed by a government on the movement of funds in and out of a country. In the case of a currency aspiring to be a reserve currency, it is important to have minimal or no capital controls to facilitate free movement of capital across borders. Capital controls can limit the liquidity and flexibility of a currency in international transactions, which can impact its attractiveness as a reserve currency.</p>



<p>China has been known for implementing capital controls to manage its economy and financial system. These controls can include limits on the amount of capital that can be transferred out of the country, requirements for approval or documentation for cross-border transactions, and other measures to restrict capital flows. Such capital controls can hinder the free movement of funds and limit the liquidity of the Chinese yuan (CNY) in international markets, potentially affecting its suitability as a reserve currency.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The U.S. dollar (USD) Trade and Investment </strong></h3>



<p>Many countries and international companies hold substantial amounts of USD-denominated debts, including government bonds, corporate bonds, and loans. These debts are typically denominated in USD due to the historical dominance of the USD in global financial markets, and the stability and liquidity of the U.S. bond market.</p>



<p>According to data from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), as of 2021, the USD continues to dominate global foreign exchange markets, accounting for around 88% of daily forex trading volume. Additionally, the BIS also reports that the USD remains the most widely used currency for international debt securities, with a significant portion of global debt issued in USD.</p>



<p>As a result, countries and international companies that have accumulated trillions of dollars in USD-denominated debts will likely need USD for the foreseeable future to service and repay these debts. This ongoing demand for USD to settle international debts is one of the factors that support the continued use and demand for the USD in global financial markets.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>BRICS is </strong>Not Robust<strong>! </strong></h3>



<p>Trust is a crucial factor in the international monetary system, particularly for a currency to become a reserve currency. A reserve currency is a currency that is held by central banks and other international institutions as part of their foreign exchange reserves and is widely used in global trade and finance.</p>



<p>The BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) are a group of emerging economies that pose as potential challengers to the dominance of traditional reserve currencies like the U.S. dollar. However, despite their economic potential, the BRICS countries face challenges in establishing mutual trust among themselves. These challenges may include geopolitical tensions, economic disparities, and differences in monetary policies and regulations, which could affect their ability to fully trust and rely on each other&#8217;s currencies.</p>



<p>While the BRICS countries have made efforts to promote intra-BRICS trade and investment, the use of their currencies in international trade and finance remains relatively limited compared to traditional reserve currencies. According to data from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), as of 2021, the share of BRICS currencies in global foreign exchange reserves remains relatively small, with the U.S. dollar and the euro continuing to dominate as reserve currencies.</p>



<p>On the other hand, Russia, that is a critical member of the BRICS is currently facing serious challenges in Ukraine. Consequently, this has deeply affected Russia in terms of economy. As they are growing desperate, countries like China are taking advantage of the sanctions imposed on Russia. For instance, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/chinas-march-imports-russian-oil-may-hit-record-shiptracking-data-2023-03-02/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">China’s import of Russian crude oil</a> is now hitting historical levels. Simultaneously, reports indicated that Russia is selling their oil. Petrol and natural gas at huge discounts to China solely out of desperation for money. Now, you can’t necessarily consider China a proper ally if you were Putin would you?</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>US Dollar Collapse Will Damage Chinese Economy </strong></h3>



<p>China is in fact the biggest customer for the US dollar. As the world&#8217;s second-largest economy, China has a significant presence in global trade and is a major exporter. It is true that a significant portion of China&#8217;s exports is denominated in U.S. dollars. According to data from the U.S. Census Bureau, in 2020, China&#8217;s total exports to the United States amounted to over $450 billion, making the U.S. one of China&#8217;s largest export markets.</p>



<p>In order to facilitate international trade, many countries, including China, conduct their trade transactions in U.S. dollars. This is because the U.S. dollar is a dominant global medium of exchange and serves as the dominant currency for international trade and finance. The use of the U.S. dollar in global trade allows countries to access international markets, facilitate cross-border transactions, and conduct business with other countries.</p>



<p>However, it&#8217;s worth noting that while the U.S. dollar plays a significant role in China&#8217;s export-driven economy, China has also been taking steps to diversify its trade and reduce its reliance on the U.S. dollar. China has been actively promoting the use of its own currency, the Chinese yuan (CNY), in international trade and investment, and has established currency swap agreements with various countries to promote direct bilateral trade in their respective currencies. Additionally, China has been working to develop alternative payment systems and financial infrastructure to reduce its dependence on the U.S. dollar in international trade and finance.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Will Bitcoin Trigger the US Dollar Collapse?</strong></h2>



<p>Cryptocurrencies, including the most well-known one, Bitcoin, have gained attention as a digital form of currency that operates outside the traditional financial system and is not tied to any particular country&#8217;s currency, including the U.S. dollar. While cryptocurrencies have gained popularity and acceptance in some circles, they currently do not pose a significant threat as a direct replacement for the U.S. dollar or any other global reserve currency for several reasons.</p>



<p>First, cryptocurrencies are relatively new and still face significant challenges in terms of regulatory and legal frameworks, scalability, stability, and acceptance by mainstream financial institutions and governments.</p>



<p>Second, cryptocurrencies are volatile and price fluctuations, which can impact their suitability as a stable medium of exchange and store of value. The lack of stability and the speculative nature of cryptocurrencies pose risks for businesses and governments in terms of pricing, risk management, and financial stability.</p>



<p>Third, while cryptocurrencies offer certain advantages such as faster and cheaper cross-border transactions, they also come with risks, including potential for money laundering, fraud, and lack of consumer protection.</p>



<p>Ultimately, while cryptocurrencies have gained attention and acceptance in some circles, they currently do not pose a significant threat as a direct replacement for the U.S. dollar or any other global reserve currency. The challenges of regulatory frameworks, volatility, stability, acceptance, and risks associated with cryptocurrencies limit their potential to replace traditional currencies in global trade and finance.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if cryptocurrencies were to replace the US dollar, the whales and industry CEOs will have an unprecedented influence on the world’s economy and it’s really terrifying to say the least!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-will-the-us-dollar-collapse"><strong>Will the US Dollar Collapse?</strong></h2>



<p>According to Murphy’s law, anything that can go wrong will go wrong. Personally speaking, I saw the murphy’s law manifest to reality last month since anything that could go wrong with a motorcycle went wrong with my motorcycle and it was in the shop for two weeks and it was really annoying and that’s probably why I got mad consuming all the content about the US dollar collapse content! The point is, unless something radical occurs, no Yuan or Bitcoin can replace the US dollar anytime soon.</p>



<p>Can we all agree that the United States is politically divided? If so, then we can clearly see how both sides of the political spectrum could use a strong dose of fear mongering to promote their own campaign. While it’s impossible to call the trending of “US dollar collapse” an orchestrated political hoax, most of the content out there seems to be following an unsubstantiated discourse. &nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In my line of work, we use our article’s keyword in the first sentence to maximize SEO. For this one, the word is Crypto market. Now, while talking about this perplexingly controversial topic, one must certainly maintain a certain disinterestedness that Matthew Arnold, the British Poet puts forward. In essence, disinterested means no matter how many Bitcoins and shitcoins you hodl, your critical thinking remains intact. Welp, tell that to the Twitter bots!</p>



<p>Obviously, using our keyword crypto market one more time in the introduction does increase our SEO optimization. But, in a time when <a href="https://blog.hi.exchange/michael-saylor-steps-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Michael Saylor</a> is getting praises on social media, crypto market is a funny thing. With around a billion dollars down, the term loss is transcending our realization. Funny enough, loss used to be either realized or unrealized. However, we are past that structural, western metaphysics binary type of thinking. Just like our gender, loss is no longer binary and resides somewhere on a spectrum. In fact, loss is considered derogatory in finance since there are no losers, it’s all future Martians and whales.</p>



<p>These days, even finance is on a spectrum. The object, the thing that is money is a mere <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiL94_DyLv5AhVEM1kFHWUDDcwQFnoECBAQAw&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewderrida.wordpress.com%2Fcategory%2Fsome-key-terms%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw0Zrr3U_xNbfap7pdiwybIQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">transcendental signified</a>. And of course, this article holds or even hodls an extreme dose of sarcasm.</p>



<p>Before I jump to the next title, know that it’s crucial to use the keyword in the titles, so just ignore it.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Crypto Market and Realization</strong></h2>



<p>Financially speaking, unrealized loss is a &#8220;paper loss that results from holding an asset that has decreased in price, but not yet selling it and realizing the loss”. This is according to <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjHt52dybv5AhWTFFkFHaOLD2YQFnoECBIQAw&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.investopedia.com%2Fterms%2Fu%2Funrealizedloss.asp&amp;usg=AOvVaw1RkCoxiOr2wngDzP8JQwYn" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Investopedia</a>. Yet, 2022 is the year to redefine every single term and rewrite history to improve it. Yes, we should look at these terms philosophically. Philosophically speaking, when a company is down $1 billion dollars, it’s not necessarily loss. In this case, loss is just a word and post-structuralism says that words are empty.</p>



<p>Funny enough, the word win is pretty much the same. For instance, when Elon sold almost $1 billion Bitcoin, he didn’t necessarily win. Let’s use our keyword crypto market one more time for giggles.</p>



<p>Does it all sound strangely queer at this point to redefine and reinvent all these terms? Let me justify. As a matter of fact, justification is the key to decrypt a mystery that lies within the Tweets and podcasts.</p>



<p>Justification is plenty these days. It comes from opinions that come from feelings. Feelings, that come from desperation and fear. An anxiety that pushes us to buy poopoocoins. Because, just like you, I do walk in front of luxury homes that I can’t possibly buy or rent in my lifetime. We take chances to break free just like the Russian people did in 1917. Danish philosopher Soren Kierkegaard invented the word angst. Basically, he said that as we get closer to our demise, we have more fear of not getting to what we want.&nbsp; And that, is the anxiety that pushes us to buy cryptocurrencies named after kitchen appliances. And guess what, capitalism knows this fear, the 18-year-old tech billionaires know what you fear the most. Your angst is what generates revenue. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>It&#8217;s Always Funny in Corporate Era</strong></h2>



<p>Bear with me, it’s the last time I use the crypto market keyword in this article. But, it is still relevant to the next topic. This market came to be as a revolution, a fight against corporation. Just like all the startups that apparently detest the corporate model but later on go full corporate, this market changed.</p>



<p>Somehow, somewhere before Covid Crypto went full corporate. The decentralized turned centralized and philosophy entered the chat. Remember how we talked about justification? This is where it matters. All this change for the worse, all the fraudulent endeavors, all the absurdity happened. Billionaires lied to us and became trillionaires and kept on lying. Elon sold and DoKwon messed up and Michael Saylor hodled his way down to the grave. How did they do it? With lots and lots of justification. Out there, trending on Twitter, every day and every hour, every person or every bot, they justify. Wordplay, poetry, philosophy, semantics, it’s all there to capitalize on the angst that is tearing the world apart. They know who you are, and they know where you live. And, they will justify why you should invest because if you don’t, you will die broke.</p>



<p>Yet, what matters is the honest-working proletariat all around the world who sold his angst to the Silicon Valley autistic demons. What actually matters, is how 43 hours a week worth of labor went to 3AC with the hope of getting returns.</p>



<p>Ironically, it’s funny how capitalism sold us a revolution against capitalism. It is very funny how much the revolt against centralized power cost the world. However, it’s actually hysterical how it will keep going in the future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Efficient payment system, algorithmic, decentralized future governance token and smart protocols. These are big words, academic based terminology for technological developments ahead of their times. Big words, awesome ideas for the future promising us better times. All you need to build this future is to invest in it. I should use a keyword for this article and it is crypto apocalypse. A time when promises made by educated rocket scientists turn out to be garbage. And in this crypto apocalypse, the above mentioned technological terms lose their value like LUNA did. Stablecoins are edgy and unstable, decentralized cryptocurrencies are centralized and big exchange platforms own your assets. More importantly, Michael Saylor who is officially convicted of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_J._Saylor#SEC_investigation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fraud</a> is telling everyone to just buy Bitcoin. So, while the hell fire is raining down upon our portfolio, let’s just talk the crypto apocalypse.</p>



<p>Buy and Sell Cryptocurrencies with no Intermediaries on <a href="http://www.hi.exchange" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jolixo</a></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Algorithmic Stablecoin (Sigh)</strong></h2>



<p>You can’t beat science. Science says we could create an algorithm to take advantage of arbitrage in order to peg the value of a coin to the US dollar. It’s all there on the whitepaper which is airtight and legit. After all, liquidity off-chain stablecoins are for the weak because they lie about their reserve. Be that as it may, the <a href="https://blog.hi.exchange/algorithmic-stablecoin-djed-cardano/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">algorithmic stablecoin</a> is the smart solution to move away from primitive technologies.</p>



<p>Speaking of science, there are now scientists in charge of finance. Coming up with bright ideas like Terra USD (UST) and exchange platforms like Coinbase and crypto.com. They have revolutionary plans for everything and no time for improvements. Everything has to be revolutionary and quick. Because, the modern day investor is desperate to prove their boomer parents that the time for labor is over. Therefore, they jump onboard any train of headed to the promised land. Trains designed by scientists (eye roll) and Harvard graduates. And at times, they might jump onboard a greyhound bus headed to North Korea.</p>



<p>Why? Because Jordan Belfort told them on Twitter that BTC will hit $100k sometime soon.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Crypto Apocalypse</strong></h2>



<p>May 2022 will probably go down in history as crypto’s first Lehman moment. A week of bear claws and carnage while billions of dollars vanished like marvel’s people after Thanos snapped. It’s basically like the bear attack scene from the movie revenant when DiCaprio got a vibe check from a mama bear. Or, the opening scene from Saving Private Ryan where the fraudsters shot down amateur investors with their reality check.</p>



<p>The crypto apocalypse was a real one. A glimpse into just how much nonsense can hide behind technical jargon. Do Kwon may have lost this round, but years later he will appear on the Joe Rogan Experience and Martin Scorsese will make a cool movie about him. Billions lost in three days, but Do Kwon will come back on Twitter telling the poor folk to invest or die broke.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>jolixo</strong></h2>



<p><strong><a href="http://hi.exchange" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jolixo</a> is a decentralized online platform to exchange your cryptocurrencies and e-currencies</strong>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>But, JP Morgan analysts said Bitcoin was a hedge against inflation! Steve Wozniak called BTC “Mathematically pure” and Twitter bros promised us it would be above $100k by now, what happened? You know when you download Dark Souls and within minutes you face the first boss fight and realize “well, damn! I’m not up for this one”. In this case, Bitcoin faced its first serious challenge this week and the results were disappointing. Unfortunately, we witnessed yet another Bitcoin crash on Thursday when Russia finally invaded Ukraine. Which brings us to a fundamental question, is Bitcoin a store of value, a hedge against inflation, a haven asset? Or is it a risk-on asset? The latest Bitcoin crash shattered BTC’s libertarian-warrior image as a fiat killer or a gold alternative. A <a href="https://blog.hi.exchange/crypto-market-will-follow-stock-market/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">statement</a> we had previously discussed. However, that doesn’t mean cryptocurrencies are done for good.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">Exchange Bitcoin to PayPal on <a href="http://www.hi.exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jolixo</a> instantly. No KYC -24/7 Online Support.</span></p></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bitcoin Crash (Again)</strong></h2>



<p>BTC is down almost 13% since last week and trading below $36,000 (at the time of writing this article). Soon after the Russian invasion on Ukraine, Bitcoin price fell 8% while the total crypto market cap tanked 7.8% in the meantime.</p>



<p>Subsequently, the crypto market saw $242 million in liquidations within hours while BTC and ETH traders took the biggest hit. With that, Bitcoin crash had $64.6 million in liquidations while Ethereum and Solana reached $54.4 million and $6.09 million respectively. Obviously, the predominant majority of the liquidated traders held long positions which was audacious to say the least.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="156" src="https://blog.hi.exchange/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/IR6KDXFCLJAWVAF7I3JJFM7UMM-1024x156.png" alt="" class="wp-image-4940" srcset="https://hi.exchange/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/IR6KDXFCLJAWVAF7I3JJFM7UMM-1024x156.png 1024w, https://hi.exchange/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/IR6KDXFCLJAWVAF7I3JJFM7UMM-300x46.png 300w, https://hi.exchange/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/IR6KDXFCLJAWVAF7I3JJFM7UMM-768x117.png 768w, https://hi.exchange/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/IR6KDXFCLJAWVAF7I3JJFM7UMM-1536x235.png 1536w, https://hi.exchange/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/IR6KDXFCLJAWVAF7I3JJFM7UMM.png 1591w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Credit: Coinglass</figcaption></figure>



<p>Similarly, almost all equity markets suffered in the same manner while the plunges maintained an average of less than 5%.</p>



<p>On the other hand, gold, oil, base metals, agriculture commodities and currency market safe havens like the U.S. dollar and the Japanese all had strong rallies across the board. In fact, Oil reached a new record gold is pretty much looking to do the same.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The $30k Support</strong></h2>



<p>At this point, the investor sentiment indicates a lack of faith in crypto as a haven asset or a solid store of value. Unlike what has been advertised, Bitcoin failed in the flight to safety event while gold went up. Furthermore, the financial markets are more volatile than ever not just because of Ukraine. The US inflation data, the Chinese real-estate collapse, the energy crisis all around the world and supply shortage issues are weighing heavy on equity markets. Hence, it is fair to say that further instability and turmoil is to come. In such case, the crypto market is set on a predictable bearish path unless investors feel a lot more confident about cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p>Let’s face it, the majority of institutional investors joined the crypto market in 2021. Tesla for example, purchased $1.5 billion in BTC in January with an estimated value of $33,000 per Bitcoin. This purchase alone caused a historical rally for the crypto market that encourage other institutions to chip in. Despite the crypto ban in China, Bitcoin did not fall below the key support level at $30,000 in the summer of 2021.</p>



<p>Yet again, here we are at another point in history when BTC is standing right on the edge of losing the crucial $30k support. If, Bitcoin falls below $30,000, the loss of capital will be devastating institutions which could then result in a massive sell-off. Sadly, this is no time to take risks as the future hold severe uncertainty for investors.</p>



<p>Of course, this risk-on asset status for Bitcoin can turn on a dime. But what it requires is a compelling reason for investors to sell their gold and other haven assets. Thus, it is impossible at this point to predict what could cause this turnaround.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>jolixo</strong></h2>



<p><strong><a href="http://hi.exchange" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jolixo</a> is a decentralized online platform to exchange your cryptocurrencies and e-currencies</strong>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>For as long as markets have been around, the Analyst has tried to tell people what will happen next. Ultimately, considering this prophesier figure suffers from a kind heart that only beats when others make money. Considering how the analyst operates in a competitive environment, we remain focused on the crypto expert kind. Keep in mind that if any prediction proves false, the analyst avoids responsibility simply because he was sharing info out of love and compassion. In reality, you would have to pay a little bit of money or even none for investment advice from him. Regardless of who you might be, the analyst will take your hand and lead you to wealth and lamborghinis. If you truly listen to his calling, the market will only be an open book for you to read from behind his insightful eyes.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Technical and Fundamental</strong></h2>



<p>Cryptocurrencies have a perplex market to say the least. There are endless elements that can affect the market on various scales. Some try to make sense of it by technical analysis, others look for fundamental elements. However, life doesn’t have to be that hard! Just open Twitter or Instagram and read away all the predictions. In fact, while you’re at it, enjoy some of the suspenseful and curiosity provoking titles such as “Here is what’s next for Bitcoin” or “these altcoins will go to the moon”.</p>



<p>And honestly, they do a good job convincing the reader to agree with their analysis. They share charts with some red lines and dots pointing out the highs and lows and illustrating the price channels.</p>



<p>The question remains, why would someone who is blessed with such foresight, share it with others. Well, they’re not in it for the money, but only to tell what is coming next, just like Noah. Kindness is not a virtue, but rather a mission for the analyst since he lives and breathes for the goal of sharing life-changing financial information with the masses.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Believe the Analyst</strong></h2>



<p>As boomers would remember, back in the old days, brokers gave people financial advice and analysis-based predictions. Later on, investors preferred analysis from independent experts and paid them for it. Yet, these days you can easily find analysis articles on the internet for free.</p>



<p>By taking a look at this evolutionary process, we can see that as time goes by, caring and sharing grows in our society. What was once considered as expensive and difficult to find, is now readily available on all your devices.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Bitcoin miner has been making our lives better for quite a long time. You may not know it, but it takes millions of computers to handle 4.6 transactions per second on the Bitcoin network. So let us all take a moment and thank the Bitcoin miner for his hard labor. Surely, a vast majority of the chip shortage is his fault. Definitely, the fact that you have to pay double for a PS5 or a graphic card is his doing. But, it will all payoff in a decentralized future where Satoshi takes down the central banks and makes everyone equally rich.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Thank You Bitcoin Miner</strong></h2>



<p>Two Russian billionaires walk into a bar. One (let’s call him Igor) sees the other and goes “Hey, I have the same suit you’re wearing; how much did you pay for it?” The other (this one is Oleg) responds “$5000 dollars!” Igor looks at him with a smug look and says” You idiot, I bought the same suit for $6000”.</p>



<p>The point is, even though the chip shortage is making us pay more than the designated price, it makes us feel like a Russian billionaire. There is a sense of raw power in being able to buy a Nintendo switch from a scalper at three times the price. And to make it even better, these hard times will lead us into a future with no fiat currency. After all, why not trust the libertarians for once?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>BTC is a Trojan Horse Bro</strong></h2>



<p>Remember the 4.6 transactions per second on Bitcoin network? The Solana has 50,000 transactions per second and consumes much lower energy to do so. However, Bitcoin is better in the eyes of the Bitcoin miner. This rationality is justified by a simple fact. There is a secret that all governments in the world are unaware of. And before we drop the “T” bomb on you, make sure to keep it hush-hush.</p>



<p>Politicians don’t know this but the libertarian crypto brotherhood is slowly bringing down the capitalist world economy. Bitcoin is a Trojan horse, it makes money from electricity and is “mathematically pure”. But, governments see this and get greedy. They invest in mining and make money. In the meantime, the crypto market gains dominance and weakens the conventional fiat markets. With enough time passed, Bitcoin will bring down every single government as they succumb to the will of people.</p>



<p>This information is top-secret and no politician or regulator or even strategist has even thought about it before.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Fight the Power!</strong></h2>



<p>The Bitcoin miner is at war. A noble war fought not for capital but for liberation. And at times of war, you will have to wait in line to buy anything with a chip inside it. At times of war, millions of ASICs have to pollute the air and heat up the planet. Power outages and environmental damages are simply casualties.</p>



<p>The Bitcoin miner is not alone in this war however. There is a mining council that decides the fate of all investors. Just like they decided to create a <a href="https://blog.hi.exchange/looking-back-at-bitcoin-rally-on-october/">supply shock in October</a> and make Bitcoin great again. &nbsp;Never mind the bear market for the rest of the 2021 and billions in liquidations. This will all make sense in a few years when we live in metaverse and brag about how much we paid for our legendary skins.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>All the crypto haters, where do they all belong? You see him on the subway coming back from work. A man of sincere pessimism, reliant on Obamacare. He who cares not about passive income but appreciates free coffee in his office. A man who finds markets to be just another form of gambling with extra steps. It is right my fellow Cryptoknights, it is indeed the tale of the crypto hater.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A Life Worth Living</strong></h2>



<p>Arthur Schopenhauer would describe this man a “sage”. A man who rejects the Will-to-Life and overrides all desires. This noble effort will surely cause the crypto hater to reject any hustle and live a peaceful and stable life. Stability is a keyword here, since the crypto hater will have lots and lots of it. Living in the same house for decades? Yes. Riding the same car for decades? Well yes again. Struggling with mortgage and refinancing the house might be persistent but it is stability and it is good.</p>



<p>Upon talking to this righteous fellow, he will tell you how risking your capital on cryptocurrencies is a tragic mistake. The hater will let you know how what goes up must come down and the almost $3 trillion-dollar market is all fake. Despite the 17000% growth Solana has had, he calls it a bad investment. The crypto hater community is diverse in nature. In general, they could be divided into two categories. The active and the passive haters.</p>



<p>The active community has knowledge and information regarding cryptocurrencies and the market. They hit you with facts and logic about how the market will collapse this week. Only to be let down by Shiba Inu’s next rally the day after. The active hater community has predicted 8 out of the 7 market crashes so far.</p>



<p>On the other hand, the passive hater community does not know and does not care. They have bigger fish to fry, like their legal fees for divorce. They just hate crypto for what it is.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Crypto Hater’s Plan</strong></h2>



<p>You may ask, but does he really enjoy stagnancy? Or is he looking for financial solutions to improve his status. To answer that, we must row upon the shallow waters of boomer lifestyle.</p>



<p>Of course he wants a better life, and his vision is pursued by starting a restaurant or investing in real estate. He might even flip cars for a while.  Better yet, the stock market is the only market he can trust. After all, the SEC is looking out for investors like him and the market can never collapse. You see, all cryptocurrencies are fraud but the wall-street boys are all good and forward-thinking. IPO’s are supervised by the SEC and safe but ICO’s are the wretched resurrection of evil.</p>



<p>Long and short of it, he seeks to improve his account balance by playing it safe. Because you have to work for 40 long years to be able to afford an SUV. This is what he believes, you have to work 40 hours a week for thousands of weeks so you could finally be able to relax on a beach. Money should be earned with years of excruciating labor and arthritis. It is true that he suffers behind a desk for days on end, but at least he is not worried about his portfolio.</p>

<p>The financial regulator is there to serve and to protect. To tax the rich and to bring financial stability to the nation. It is a noble quest to supervise and regulate all financial activity in a nation. It is 2021, inflation is insane, people are losing jobs, Biden’s administration is gonna make rich people feel the pain.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Financial Regulator to the Rescue</strong></h2>



<p>The world is unfair, there are those who print money in times of need and cause hyperinflation. There are companies who sell a total of million cars in a couple of years and are worth more than Ford who sells 20 million a year. There are people who impose tax on common people and neglect the rich.</p>



<p>But, the financial regulator does not care about that. He or She is only concerned with the safety of investors assets. And to make the world a better place, they call for more taxes and more regulations right where it hits the common folk.</p>



<p>However, at this point one should not forget that the regulator is not a US native. They are everywhere across the globe.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Smart Regulator</strong></h2>



<p>First and foremost, people need to keep calm. In the event of a sinking ship, what matters is that the people remain on their seats as they sink. Just look back at 2008 financial collapse. A few months before that, everyone was assured that the mortgage section is solid, secure and safe. This is important because if they didn’t keep calm, there would have been an even bigger collapse.</p>



<p>You see, the inflation is growing at record levels in the US. In China, the real estate market which makes up one third of the nation’s income is literally torn to pieces. In Brazil, India and Germany there is an energy crisis going on. Australia is like a high security dystopian prison where the citizens are ordered to limit their commute. Yet, what matters is that cryptocurrencies are taxed.</p>



<p>The passive income which helped save the livelihood of the people should be taxed. This is all because crypto is unsafe. Central bankers and policy makers who print money are good people. Marxist politicians who officially state on the TV that there would be no inflation are good people. Just don’t buy Ethereum because it is volatile.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Financial Regulator Dilemma</strong></h2>



<p>Long story short, ain’t nobody got time to look for the cause. Nobody is interested to imprison those who lie with a straight face about the future. The financial expert does not care about the trillions of dollars spent on war. Instead, they go bald behind their generic office desks looking for solutions. And boy do they come up with them!</p>



<p>Don’t have faith in them? Just take a look at how successful they are in controlling inflation, bubbles and fraudulent ventures.</p>

<p>This is how it works, life is easy in the metaverse. You work there, you live there and most definitely party in the metaverse. A world of endless opportunities, as you are given absolute liberty to do what your heart desires. Killing noobs on the weekends? Well, how about killing noobs on Sabbath? After all, a decentralized future knows no boundaries.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Enter the Metaverse</strong></h2>



<p>Plug in your RTX 3090 and break free of the disgusting physical reality. Walk in the world of your dreams and let go of all that is real. Let your phantom sensation devour your soul as you hunt down Avatars in the EA Games servers.</p>



<p>Imagine a world where money does not matter, just plug in your RTX 3090 and let it mine whatever coin its heart desires. After all, this is the decentralized future Elon Musk and Michael Saylor and Vitalik Buterin promised us. This is the future where you don’t have to work, money is made completely passively. Fiat money is dead, so are the central bankers. All the wealth is mined and distributed on the blockchain network. A future where all the markets are having 17000% growth every single day.</p>



<p>And most importantly, in this future there are no rich people. All the crypto whales have donated their assets to charity. You can see them dancing on the streets of metaverse with others singing the songs of joy and fellowship.</p>



<p>Mark Zuckerberg is catching Pokémons in his backyard and no longer cares about money. Satoshi Nakamoto is still anonymous and The queen of England has an NFT collection on OpenSea.</p>



<p>And you, my fellow decentralized blockchain based friend, you are free. You have an NFT wife, an NFT house and a Non-Fungible Token of a child. You are Happy, anonymously with low gas fees.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>As I Walk into the Metaverse</strong></h2>



<p>You might be wondering, how is this future possible with all the benefits? The answer is Web 3.0 and DApps as well as the Artificial Intelligence. In near future, Elon Musk will give humanity free electricity with zero pollution, all we need to do is to buy Tesla stocks right now. Also, Shiba Inu will grow a million percent in 2022 making everybody a billionaire. With that, all fiat based markets will collapse and gold will be worth zero.</p>



<p>To make it happen, we must have faith in the words of tech billionaires. They want what is best for us. At the end of the day, how can you not trust someone who has multiple billions of dollars. They have won life; they have all the money. At this point, all they truly want is to make the lives of other easy and beautiful. It makes no sense to pursuit power or dominance over others. The only reason Bill Gates wakes up early every day is to make the world great again. Otherwise, they would be either mad or evil to work.</p>



<p>Long story short, Metaverse is the future where you will only win and can never lose. Life is easy in the metaverse.</p>

<p>The crypto philosopher is the broad thinker, the seeker of knowledge outside the bounds of being and time. Fascinated with the big picture, he makes observations and hastily shares his precious thoughts with others. These luminary figures are mostly found in podcast episodes and are seldom bullish on every single thing ever. Welcome, to the tale of the Crypto Philosopher.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Thus Spoke Crypto Philosopher</strong></h2>



<p>You know how the capitalism serves a hegemony that robs the people of their wealth? Crypto fixes that. Also, you know how communism fails to deliver any promise ever? Crypto fixes that. The crypto philosopher would tell you how everything is about to change as governments lose control.</p>



<p>He will enchant everyone with allegories, analogies and metaphors to share his excitement of the coming of a new era. Deep in his heart, this intellectual gem faithfully believes that crypto can solve the energy crisis, the water crisis, the climate crisis and defeat every possible challenge.</p>



<p>Grand Theft Auto 6 taking too long to release? You guessed it, crypto can fix that.</p>



<p>In terms of political affiliation, the philosopher community is libertarian. Meaning that pumps and dumps and rug pulls are just happy little accidents. There should be no regulations on anything simply because “free market bro!”.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Fight the Power</strong></h2>



<p>The revolution has begun; the governments will lose all their power to the people as the age of equity begins. Cryptocurrencies will lead the way to fight the hierarchical structures of old with unmatched liberty.</p>



<p>The crypto philosopher is not far from the <a href="https://blog.hi.exchange/tales-from-the-chain-chapter-v-bitcoin-maximalist/">Bitcoin Maximalist</a>. They both fight against Fiat currencies and absolutely hate central banks. The goal is to achieve as much freedom as possible like the Spanish civil war days.</p>



<p>Surprising to no one, their favorite marketing format is podcast because their wealth of knowledge cannot be contained in limited form. And so, these thinkers bless the audience with 5-hour long episodes of discourse about the sweet downfall of all political structures.</p>



<p>At the end of the day, the libertarian vision will come through as the bourgeoisie admit defeat. The crypto philosopher believes in this. There will be no authority, no taxes and no injustice, dictatorship will vanish from the face of the earth and all resources shall be redistributed equally among people. There will be no more homelessness as everyone makes easy passive income from cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p>And that, is a vision to fight for.</p>

Investors need to be careful about taking financial advice from others. We do not intend to make fun of any person for their investment decisions or use derogatory terms to describe them.
