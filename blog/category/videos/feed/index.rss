<p>Lark Davis &#8211; the well-known audacious researcher and forecaster of renowned digital currency analysts &#8211; ecstatic digital currency enthusiasts and investors regarding his prediction of Ethereum in 2024.</p>



<p>In his most recent YouTube video, Davis dug into the untapped potential of Ethereum and insisted that crypto bases are the way to get rich with Ethereum. However, this is by no means an easy or straightforward path.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe title="Ethereum Will Make Millionaires In 2024, BUT Not How You Think" width="800" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dYiBe72ww6k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Ethereum price path in 2024</h2>



<p>According to Davis, Ethereum can reach $10,000 to $15,000. He emphasizes that simply buying and holding Ethereum is not a golden ticket to wealth. At Ethereum&#8217;s current price of $2,295, investors are likely to see a 600% return, which is very remarkable. But Davis points to more lucrative opportunities.</p>



<p>There are fundamental financial changes in Ethereum layer two solutions. Networks built on top of Ethereum to increase its scalability and efficiency. He emphasizes that these layer two platforms, such as StarkNet, ZK Sync, and others, are much more than Ethereum. They cause the explosive growth of the price of this currency.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Prospects for 2024 Ethereum price growth</h2>



<p>According to Davis, these Layer 2 networks should be monitored for new token listings. He mentions Celestia as an example, which witnessed a 500% gain just one month after going public. Keeping an eye on these new listings can be significant for people hoping to make substantial earnings rapidly.</p>



<p>Davis also highlights the possibility of airdrops in the Layer 2 space. He shares details on how to take part in these airdrops by chain activities and staking, such as the Manta Network and zkSync programs. Compared to conventional ETH investments, these airdrops have the potential to be more profitable, more immediate, and generate greater returns.</p>



<p>The value of the largest altcoin was $2,295 at the time of publication. A few analysts expect it to increase to $2,500 in the final five days of the year. The weekly and daily charts for Ethereum are currently showing green, and the Fear and Greed indicator is shifting in favor of Greed, indicating strong bullishness. Furthermore, Ether is anticipated to be among the leaders of the anticipated uptrend in 2024.</p>

<p>In Boomer terms, a Perfect Money E-Voucher is basically like a bank check but digital. Basically, users can create a Perfect Money E-Voucher with a certain value and use it as a redeemable transaction for a variety of purposes. Thankfully, these vouchers are instantly redeemable via a code and a pin which could easily be sent via SMS, E-mail or any form of online messaging. In terms of use cases, the applications are endless since it is an accessible form of payment for both the sender and the receiver. In this article, we will go through everything you need to know about the Perfect Money E-Voucher and how to make one instantly.</p>

</div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-perfect-money-e-voucher"><strong>Perfect Money E-Voucher</strong></h2>



<p>it is easy, it is affordable and it is anonymous a lot like the CoinCannon Platform! The E-Voucher is the solution to some of our biggest payment problems. The electronic voucher is a method of payment that is redeemable instantly. The user pays a specific amount of funds and creates a voucher. Then, the information for the voucher can easily be delivered to the receiver and they will have the choice to redeem the payment anytime they want. Much like a gift card or a bank check, the voucher will hold the value permanently since the payment has already been made.</p>



<p>Although there are numerous applications for this, here are some of the common utilities:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>You can create a voucher to make payments when you don’t have access to your Perfect Money account.</li>



<li>Perfect Money E-Voucher is a good method of payment when you don’t carry cash or traveling abroad.</li>



<li>As a service provider, users can receive vouchers if they don’t wish to reveal their account address.</li>



<li>Send your loved ones a voucher instead of a gift card</li>
</ul>



<p>Perfect Money E-Voucher does not cost users a lot of money to make! You can simply go to CoinCannon and create your voucher immediately with the lowest fees. On top of that, unlike a majority of exchanges, CoinCannon does not require KYC (know your customer) or even a sign up process. It is truly fast and truly anonymous.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-perfect-money"><strong>What is Perfect Money?</strong></h2>



<p>Perfect Money is an e-currency for making payments on the internet. It is widely accepted as payment option by countless platforms. With Perfect Money, you can do a lot! Be it transferring funds to others or pay for goods and services. Or how about buying cryptocurrencies or even buying fiat currencies. It is a seriously popular payment method for online users. An additional capability is to loan and receipt issuance throughout the system.</p>



<p>The biggest downside of Perfect Money, however, is that you cannot cash Perfect money to your bank account on its website directly. For that, you will need a platform like CoinCannon to exchange your Perfect Money to PayPal and other e-currencies.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-jolixo-does-it-better"><strong>CoinCannon Does It Better!</strong></h2>



<p>Essentially, you need three primary qualities in an ideal exchange platform. Anonymity, good rates and reliability. The CoinCannon team consists of traders and professionals who have felt the need for an ideal exchange and pursued their vision.</p>



<p>First and foremost, all users need to protect their personal information especially when it comes down to financial transactions. Unfortunately, a vast majority of exchange apps and platforms make massive profits off of selling user data. Best case scenario, they are legally bound to disclose user information with national authorities for any reason. In that regard, the best method to protect your privacy is to not disclose them with anyone at all. CoinCannon does not require customers to go through KYC (know your customer) or even a mandatory sign up. In that regard, it is simply as safe as one can get making an exchange.</p>



<p>On the other hand, privacy is not a reason to pay more on your exchange. With that in mind, the platform offers some of the most competitive exchange rates you can find anywhere. Don’t take our word for it. You can simply pay a visit to ranking websites such as BestChange or OkChanger and see compare our rates with others.</p>



<p>Last but not least, not everything goes as planned in the digital world. Subsequently, the platform provides true online 24/7 customer support for the users.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What Do I Need to Buy Bitcoin with Tether?</strong></h2>



<p>For this exchange, you will need a crypto wallet to receive Bitcoin that is reliable and secure. Although there are thousands of options at this moment, we advise you to pay extra attention when choosing a Bitcoin wallet. As for CoinCannon, all you need is an email-address since no KYC (know your customer) is necessary. However, bear in mind that there are many advantages available for those who sign up on CoinCannon. Want a good reason why? How about winning $100 ever month!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is Bitcoin (BTC)?</strong></h2>



<p>Well, there is hardly anyone these days who is not familiar with the definition of Bitcoin and what the cryptocurrency is capable of carrying out. However, let’s briefly go through what bitcoin is and where it comes from, then we can focus on the benefits of using this cryptocurrency and explain why to buy Bitcoin with Perfect Money.</p>



<p>Bitcoin is a Cryptocurrency that was created after the housing market collapse in January 2009. It follows the ideas set out by the enigmatic and pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto in a whitepaper. The identity of the individual or individuals who developed this cryptocurrency is still under wraps. Unlike government-issued currencies, Bitcoin provides the guarantee of lower transaction costs than conventional online payment systems and is regulated by a decentralized authority.</p>



<p>Bitcoin is a tempting opportunity for investment and great tool for doing financial transactions. Everything is in favor of exchanging your Perfect Money for some BTC when possible.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why Pay with Tether?</strong></h2>



<p>Owning Tether is basically like having digital dollars in your pocket, only without needing a bank. Recently, there has been lots of talk about how we do not actually own our money when they are in the banks. Digital money means that banks and governments can freeze our access to our funds for whatever reason they seem justifiable. In 2022, Canada denied protestor’s access to their bank accounts and cut out their rightful ownership of their capital. Such incidents are not rare and should be treated seriously. But, political motivation aside, banks are not always available. For example, we saw how the Ukrainians lost all their capital within the banks as soon as the war started. Once again, the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies meant that the bankless were the lucky ones in that incident.</p>



<p>Thankfully, the list of online merchants and service providers who accept Tether USDT is sufficiently long. With Tether, you can make purchases online and in person almost anywhere. Be it through a direct wallet address or a payment gateway, USDT is as good as cash these days.</p>



<p>Lastly, USDT offers an extra layer of protection for the user with blockchain technology. As a cryptocurrency, it is anonymous and secure. On top of that, the transaction fees for Tether are very low, as long as you use the TRC20 variant based on the Tron network.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>CoinCannon FTW!</strong></h2>

<p>Brutal regulations are pushing exchanges to disclose customer data to governments. This goes against the initial purpose of crypto which is absolute anonymity. Even worse, user data is a commodity, large institutions buy your information at a certain price. The best way to make sure your data is safe, is to not share them at all.</p>



<p>However, it is a luxury to offer no KYC, hence many exchanges charge customers with ridiculous exchange rates to compensate for the anonymity.</p>



<p>CoinCannon on the other hand gives you everything all at once. Want privacy? We have no KYC. Want the best exchange rates? Well, simply visit Bestchange or OkChanger and see for yourself how we are always on top of their lists.</p>



<p>And to make sure everything goes right, we offer 24/7 customer support.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is Ethereum?</strong></h2>



<p>Ethereum, launched in 2015, is a blockchain-based, decentralized, and open-source software platform that is employed for Ether, its own dedicated cryptocurrency. Ethereum allows Smart Contracts and Distributed Applications to be developed and operate without any downtime, fraud, control, or intrusion from a third party.</p>



<p>Ethereum is not only a platform but also a programming language (Turing complete) operating on a blockchain, assisting developers in developing and publishing distributed applications.</p>



<p>Ethereum (ETH), the Ethereum network’s cryptocurrency, is probably the second most popular digital token after Bitcoin (BTC). Indeed, as the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap, comparison between Ether and BTC is only natural.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>PayPal is King for a Reason!</strong></h2>



<p>PayPal is an online trade company that, through online transfers, facilitates payments between parties. Its system allows clients to set up an account on its platform that is linked to the user’s credit card or checking account. Upon confirmation of identification and proof of funds, through the website or application of the company, users can begin sending or receiving payments online to and from other PayPal accounts.</p>



<p>As mentioned above, in order to transfer money to others using the receiver’s email address or mobile phone number, PayPal account holders can use the website or mobile application of the company. Within only a matter of minutes, transactions go through and the company promises that transfers are immediately available for payment or withdrawal to a bank account.</p>



<p>The ease of use and the wide acceptance makes the exchange cryptocurrencies to PayPal one of the best options when you need some cash to spend online.</p>



<p>All that said, you also have the ability to exchange ETH to Perfect Money USD or Tether USD.</p>

<p>For anonymity, CoinCannon requires no KYC or even a sign up process. The best way to protect your information is to not share them with anyone. And for that, we respect our customers and do not ask for their personal info.</p>



<p>As for affordability, CoinCannon utilizes an automated system to determine the best exchange rates at any moment. By doing so, we have managed to stay on top of the ranks on websites such as Bestchange and OkChanger.</p>



<p>Lastly, reliability is ensured for our customers with 24/7 online support. In case anything goes wrong, you will have our immediate support until the issue is resolved.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How to Exchange Ethereum to PayPal</strong></h2>



<ol class="wp-block-list" type="1"><li>Enter the Homepage on CoinCannon. Select Ethereum (ETH) on the left field and PayPal on the right one.

<p>These days, PayPal Payment is a dominant method of transaction on the internet. A vast majority of online platforms support PayPal as payment method for their goods and services. However, that doesn’t mean that everyone gets equal access to PayPal payment services. Unfortunately, many countries do not have access to PayPal services and subsequently face payment issues. Furthermore, there are those who rarely need PayPal services and just don’t feel compelled to create an account. But, when the time comes, they might need to make a PayPal payment instantly. Fortunately, CoinCannon PayPal Invoice service is the perfect solution to all problems stated above. It offers multiple benefits and does not cost extra commission. Stay with us as we go over everything to know about our PayPal invoice service.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe title="How to Make PayPal Payments without a PayPal Account" width="800" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Yy3JjVEEHHI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><mark style="background-color:#ffffff" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">Make PayPal Payment Without a PayPal Account on<br><a href="http://www.hi.exchange/">jolixo</a></mark></p></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Can I Make PayPal Payment Without an Account?</strong></h2>



<p>Yes, you don’t necessarily need an official PayPal account in order to make a payment. In order to do this, you will need an exchange platform to make the payment for you. This service is specifically designed for those who do not have access to a PayPal account at the moment. This could be caused by a suspended account for short-term or sanctions imposed on a country which would suspend all PayPal services indefinitely. In any case, you can use the PayPal invoice service to make the PayPal payment instantly.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>CoinCannon Does It Better</strong></h2>



<p>However, using the PayPal invoice service is only a good solution as long as you utilize a good exchange platform. Since this is a unique service, the exchangers might take a lot more commission for it as compared with a regular exchange operation. On the other hand, since you are making a purchase, the exchanger will know exactly what you purchased and how much you paid for it. Hence, your anonymity is compromised.</p>



<p>Thankfully, CoinCannon comes to the rescue! CoinCannon does not have any extra commission for the PayPal Payment and the commission rate remains the same as a regular PayPal exchange. Which means, you get to enjoy very low exchange commission with your payment.</p>



<p>In terms of privacy and anonymity, CoinCannon does not require KYC or even Sign Up. Therefore, you do not disclose any personal information with the platform.</p>



<p>Lastly, we offer 24/7 online support. So, in case you have any questions or issues, simply send us a message through the Live Chat section on the <a href="http://www.hi.exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">main page</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What Do I Need to Make a PayPal Payment?</strong></h2>



<p>In order to make PayPal payments without an account, you can use a crypto wallet and pay with Tether or Bitcoin, or a Perfect Money account. We will keep you updated upon adding other options for the payment. Make sure to visit <a href="https://blog.hi.exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CoinCannon Blog</a> regularly to stay up to date. But as a quick hint, there will be a lot more similar services available on CoinCannon very soon.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Do I Have to Pay Commission?</strong></h2>



<p>No, there will be no extra commission or hidden exchange fees to use the PayPal Invoice service. The commission rate is the same as making a standard PayPal exchange on the platform which is already pretty low. Please bear in mind, making payments via Bitcoin will have a higher transaction fee due to Bitcoin network fees.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How Can I Make a PayPal Payment Without an Account?</strong></h2>



<p>In short, since you don’t have access to a PayPal account, you send your assets to CoinCannon and the platform will make the payment from its own PayPal account. Currently, we support Bitcoin, Tether TRC20 or Perfect Money USD. Following that, CoinCannon will receive your funds and make the PayPal payment on your behalf.</p>



<p>The process is very simple!</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list" type="1"><li>Enter the CoinCannon Platform. Then, select either Perfect Money, Bitcoin or Tether TRC20 in the “I Give” section. After that, select PayPal USD (Invoice) from the “I Get” Section.</li><li>Type the Sending Amount for the payment. Then, wait until the rates automatically apply and see how much PayPal USD you will have for the payment. By the way, our exchange rates are awesome!</li><li>Click on Exchange and your will go to the second step. Add your invoice link (URL address) in the dedicated section. For example, if you’re buying a service online, add the link to the product page. Type your email address and the phone number section is optional. However, remember that there are many<a href="https://blog.hi.exchange/reasosn-sign-up-jolixo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> benefits</a> for customers who sign up.</li><li>Review the exchange information carefully. Prove that you’re not a robot (nothing personal J) and click on “Exchange”</li><li>On the forth step, you receive your Track ID. You can see the order status. Click on “Pay Order”. If you make the payment via Perfect Money, you will be directed to the Perfect Money gateway. If you’re sending BTC or Tether, you will receive CoinCannon’s wallet address. At that point, make the payment and attach a screenshot of the payment in the dedicated section.</li><li>Kindly, agree to our terms and conditions and click on “Pay Order”.</li></ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>That’s It!</strong></h2>



<p>At this point, our team will process your order and make the PayPal payment. The process might take a short while. If you have any questions or issues, you can contact our online support team via the live chat section on the website. Our services expand by the hour!

<p>Unlike a few years ago, you do not have to exchange Bitcoin to Tether (USDT) in order to pay for something. These days, having Bitcoin in your wallet is pretty much as good as cash. You can spend BTC for plethora of purchasing options. As we previously talked about the things you can <a href="https://blog.hi.exchange/buy-with-bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">buy with Bitcoin</a>, the options are endless. However, the volatility makes it hard for us to be hodlers and that is where stablecoins come to play. Most investors exchange Bitcoin to Tether to hedge against the volatility and find a safe haven until their next opportunity to invest. With that, we will go over how to exchange Bitcoin to Tether on <a href="http://www.hi.exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jolixo</a> platform with the lowest exchange fees.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why Exchange Bitcoin to Tether?</strong></h2>



<p>Generally speaking, exchanging assets to Tether is for times when you want to pay less commission and be ready for the next purchase. When you <a href="https://blog.hi.exchange/exchange-cryptocurrency-to-paypal/">exchange cryptocurrency to PayPal</a>, the cost for the exchange is considerably higher and it takes a longer time to have the assets in your account. On top of that, the next time you want to buy cryptocurrencies, you will once again have to pay high commission and wait longer. With Tether, the transactions are almost immediate and have a very low cost of transaction.</p>



<p>Comparatively, Tether is good for those who are actively monitoring the market to make their next move. Thankfully, numerous Forex platforms also accept Tether as payment so it has even more utility. On the other hand, PayPal is generally a safer method to store assets with much more regulations. Naturally, it is good for those looking for better security and purchasing options.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is Tether (USDT)?</strong></h2>



<p>Before reading about how to exchange crypto to Tether (USDT), let’s take a quick look at what Tether is and how it operates. Tether is a cryptocurrency based on blockchain whose crypto coins in use are backed by an equivalent amount of traditional fiat currencies, such as the Dollar, Euro, or Japanese Yen that is retained in a specific bank account. The Tether tokens, the Tether network’s native tokens, trade under the USDT symbol.</p>



<p>In contrast to the wide swings observed in the prices of other popular cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, Tether belongs to a new race of cryptocurrencies called stablecoins that aims to keep cryptocurrency valuations stable. Instead of being used as a means of speculative investment, this would allow Tether to be used as a medium of exchange and a mode of storage of value.</p>



<p>Tether was specifically developed to create the necessary CoinCannon between fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies, providing users with stability, transparency, and minimum transaction fees. It is pegged against the US dollar and, in terms of value, maintains a 1-to-1 ratio with USD. There is, however, no guarantee provided by Tether Ltd. for any right to redeem or exchange real money for Tethers, i.e. Tethers cannot be exchanged for U.S. Dollars.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>CoinCannon for the Win!</strong></h2>



<p>Of course, in order to exchange Bitcoin to Tether, you will first need a reliable exchange platform. For that, <a href="http://www.hi.exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jolixo</a> is one of the best options out there.</p>

By the end of this guide, you&#8217;ll have the knowledge to confidently <strong>purchase IOTA</strong> using Perfect Money. </p>



<p>Let&#8217;s explore the exciting possibilities of buying IOTA with Perfect Money in 2024!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-buy-iota-with-perfect-money"><strong>Why Buy IOTA with Perfect Money?</strong></h2>



<p>Perfect Money is an e-currency used for making payments on the internet. It is widely accepted as payment option by countless platforms. With Perfect Money, you can do a lot! Be it transferring funds to others or pay for goods and services. Or how about buying cryptocurrencies or even buying fiat currencies. It is a seriously popular payment method for online users. An additional capability is to loan and receipt issuance throughout the system.</p>



<p>The biggest downside of Perfect Money, however, is that you cannot cash Perfect money to your bank account on its website directly. For that, you will need a platform like CoinCannon to exchange your Perfect Money to PayPal and other e-currencies.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-to-buy-iota-with-perfect-money"><strong>How to Buy IOTA with Perfect Money</strong></h2>



<p>There are five easy steps for this process:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Enter the homepage first, then select Perfect Money and IOTA (MIOTA) from the options in the first step. Enter the amount you want to exchange. Following that, the amount of IOTA you will receive will automatically calculate.</li>



<li>Press Exchange and you will go to the next stage where you will enter your IOTA wallet details, email, and phone number.</li>



<li>One more time, click on the “Exchange” button and you will go to the next step where you will review your order.</li>



<li>Complete the captcha and click on exchange to go to the next step where you will obtain a tracking ID. Press the “Pay Order” button to go to the Perfect Money gateway and make the payment to our Perfect Money account. Having transferred your Perfect Money to CoinCannon, your order will process very quickly.</li>



<li>By finishing all the steps above, our team of professionals will send the IOTA to your wallet as soon as possible</li>
</ul>

<p>When you finish the steps above, our team will immediately follow up your order and make the payment to your wallet. The process might take a short while.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-jolixo-platform"><strong>CoinCannon Platform</strong></h2>



<p>Cryptocurrencies are a financial apparatus to maximize privacy and efficiency. Sadly, regulations have been severely disrupting the market as they compromise both.</p>



<p><a href="https://hi.exchange/">jolixo</a> seeks to be a platform that offers privacy and efficiency simultaneously while offering some of the most aggressive exchange rates in the market.</p>



<p>To make this happen, the platform does not require KYC or a sign up process. This way, all customers can easily make transactions without a possible compromise on their personal information.</p>



<p>However, privacy is a crucial element and not a luxury. In that regard, the platform offers some of the most competitive rates amongst all online exchanges. The rates ar automatically determined utilizing an automated system and are updated as soon as change in value is detected.</p>



<p>Last but not least, by offering true 24/7 support, all customers will be in touch with the team in case anything goes unplanned.</p>
