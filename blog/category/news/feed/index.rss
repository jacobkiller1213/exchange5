<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Key Points:</strong></h2>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>CEO of CryptoQuant, Ki Young Ju, forecasts Bitcoin&#8217;s price to soar up to $112,000 by the end of 2024, driven by anticipated inflows from Spot ETFs.</li>



<li>A potential monthly inflow of $9.5 billion from ETFs could augment Bitcoin&#8217;s actual value by $114 billion, potentially propelling the price to $112,000.</li>



<li>Ju presents an optimistic projection ranging from $104,000 to $112,000, with a more conservative estimate between $55,000 and $59,000.</li>
</ul>



<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-e6322d0116284c915cf7bc8d3aee3c30">In an insightful analysis shared by CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju, Bitcoin is poised for a remarkable ascent to $112,000 in 2024, primarily fueled by the anticipated influx of funds from exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Highlighting the pivotal role of ETF cash inflows, Ju predicts a monthly surge of $9.5 billion, augmenting Bitcoin&#8217;s actual capitalization by a staggering $114 billion annually.</p>



<p>Ju&#8217;s forecast paints a bullish picture of Bitcoin&#8217;s trajectory, envisioning a potential surge to $112,000 by the year&#8217;s end. Despite speculation regarding possible exits from Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), Ju remains optimistic about Bitcoin&#8217;s price rally, projecting a substantial increase of $76 billion in accurate capitalization. This could elevate Bitcoin&#8217;s current capitalization from $451 billion to between $527 billion and $565 billion.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="655" height="789" src="https://hi.exchange/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/فاببتع-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-8212" srcset="https://hi.exchange/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/فاببتع-1.png 655w, https://hi.exchange/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/فاببتع-1-249x300.png 249w" sizes="(max-width: 655px) 100vw, 655px" /></figure></div>


<p>Ju remains confident in Bitcoin&#8217;s resilience despite potential fluctuations, foreseeing a price range between $104,000 and $112,000 fueled by ETF inflows. Even in a more conservative scenario, Bitcoin could still maintain a strong position, trading between $55,000 and $59,000.</p>



<p>Amidst this anticipation, Bitcoin is already displaying signs of momentum, with its current weekly candle reflecting a gain of 12.58%. Trading above $48,000, Bitcoin&#8217;s volume in the last 24 hours has surged to $20.65 billion, hinting at growing investor interest and market activity.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul style="background-color:#d3d5e9" class="has-background wp-block-list">
<li>Ripple ordered to disclose financial details and XRP sales following SEC request.</li>



<li>Judge ruled distribution of XRP tokens to organizations as &#8220;unlawful sale of securities.&#8221;</li>

</ul>
</div></div>



<p>In response to a recent court order, Ripple faces the obligation to disclose further insights into the financial standing and transactions involving its native cryptocurrency, XRP.</p>



<p> This mandate follows a request from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), with Judge Analiza Torres previously ruling that the dissemination of XRP tokens to organizations constituted an &#8220;unlawful sale of securities.&#8221; However, transactions involving XRP on exchanges and among retail traders were excluded from this classification.</p>



<p>Under the court order, Ripple is now required to furnish its financial reports spanning the years 2022-2023, alongside contracts pertaining to organizational sales of XRP. These disclosures aim to illuminate critical details such as revenue generated from token sales. </p>



<p>Ripple&#8217;s opposition to this ruling signals the onset of a legal confrontation.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="977" height="397" src="https://hi.exchange/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/xrp.png" alt="" class="wp-image-8206" style="width:812px;height:auto" srcset="https://hi.exchange/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/xrp.png 977w, https://hi.exchange/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/xrp-300x122.png 300w, https://hi.exchange/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/xrp-768x312.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 977px) 100vw, 977px" /></figure>



<p>In a significant development within the ongoing lawsuit, U.S. District Judge Annalisa Torres has granted approval to the SEC&#8217;s motion, compelling Ripple to furnish additional financial statements covering the period from 2022 to 2023, along with agreements concerning &#8220;institutional sales&#8221; of XRP. </p>



<p>The SEC contends that this supplementary financial data is indispensable in determining suitable penalties and compensatory measures.</p>



<p>Despite Ripple&#8217;s objections, deeming the SEC&#8217;s requests as &#8220;untimely&#8221; and &#8220;unnecessary,&#8221; the court emphasizes the importance of this information for the litigation process. Notably, John Deaton, representing Pro-XRP holders, has recommended a fine of approximately $10 million for Ripple.</p>



<p> As the SEC gains access to further financial insights from Ripple, the lawsuit enters a pivotal juncture, carrying significant implications for both Ripple and the XRP token. Consequently, the XRP price has witnessed a notable decline, plummeting from its recent high of $3.40 to $0.41.</p>

<p>As the bearish trend of 2024 unfolds, Arthur Hayes, the former CEO of Bitmax, has shared insights into his chosen altcoins for the year. Departing from his Bitcoin focus, Hayes is now eyeing strategic investments in Solana and Bonk, signaling a shift in his cryptocurrency portfolio.</p>



<p>In a recent press release, Hayes expressed concern about Bitcoin&#8217;s struggle to maintain its position above $40,000, predicting potential further declines in the upcoming weeks. In response to this market sentiment, he has diversified his investments into the promising altcoins Solana and Bonk.</p>



<p>Hayes anticipates a 30% correction from Bitcoin&#8217;s recent high of $48,000 in 2024, especially following the approval of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). He identifies potential support levels ranging from $30,000 to $35,000. Taking a proactive stance, Hayes has already exited positions in Solana and Bonk at $35,000, even if it meant a modest loss.</p>



<p>Positioning Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies as the last bastion of global open markets, Hayes asserts their ability to predict better fluctuations in the dollar&#8217;s liquidity compared to traditional financial markets. In the event of Bitcoin falling below $35,000, Hayes plans to invest in Solana (SOL), an innovative contract platform, and Dogwifhat (WIF), a meme asset on Ethereum, employing a &#8220;fishing from the bottom&#8221; strategy.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-center is-style-default has-medium-font-size is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>&#8220;I would choose Solana and WIF over Bitcoin&#8221;  </p>
<cite>Arthur Hayes</cite></blockquote>



<p>Dogwifhat is trading at $0.343, showing a significant 50% increase in the last 24 hours. In contrast, Solana is priced at $86.16, reflecting a 5.5% uptick from the previous day. While Dogwifhat&#8217;s recent price movements have displayed volatility between $0.330 and $0.355, some experts predict a potential return to around $0.45, similar to mid-January levels. Despite Hayes&#8217; optimism, technical indicators offer mixed signals, introducing an element of uncertainty to Dogwifhat&#8217;s future price.</p>

<p>Lark Davis &#8211; the well-known audacious researcher and forecaster of renowned digital currency analysts &#8211; ecstatic digital currency enthusiasts and investors regarding his prediction of Ethereum in 2024.</p>



<p>In his most recent YouTube video, Davis dug into the untapped potential of Ethereum and insisted that crypto bases are the way to get rich with Ethereum. However, this is by no means an easy or straightforward path.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe title="Ethereum Will Make Millionaires In 2024, BUT Not How You Think" width="800" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dYiBe72ww6k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Ethereum price path in 2024</h2>



<p>According to Davis, Ethereum can reach $10,000 to $15,000. He emphasizes that simply buying and holding Ethereum is not a golden ticket to wealth. At Ethereum&#8217;s current price of $2,295, investors are likely to see a 600% return, which is very remarkable. But Davis points to more lucrative opportunities.</p>



<p>There are fundamental financial changes in Ethereum layer two solutions. Networks built on top of Ethereum to increase its scalability and efficiency. He emphasizes that these layer two platforms, such as StarkNet, ZK Sync, and others, are much more than Ethereum. They cause the explosive growth of the price of this currency.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Prospects for 2024 Ethereum price growth</h2>



<p>According to Davis, these Layer 2 networks should be monitored for new token listings. He mentions Celestia as an example, which witnessed a 500% gain just one month after going public. Keeping an eye on these new listings can be significant for people hoping to make substantial earnings rapidly.</p>



<p>Davis also highlights the possibility of airdrops in the Layer 2 space. He shares details on how to take part in these airdrops by chain activities and staking, such as the Manta Network and zkSync programs. Compared to conventional ETH investments, these airdrops have the potential to be more profitable, more immediate, and generate greater returns.</p>



<p>The value of the largest altcoin was $2,295 at the time of publication. A few analysts expect it to increase to $2,500 in the final five days of the year. The weekly and daily charts for Ethereum are currently showing green, and the Fear and Greed indicator is shifting in favor of Greed, indicating strong bullishness. Furthermore, Ether is anticipated to be among the leaders of the anticipated uptrend in 2024.</p>

<p>Despite the most recent changes regarding the Bitcoin ETF, the landscape of virtual currencies is once more in the midst of a profound shift. The most valuable cryptocurrency in the world of digital assets, Bitcoin, has recently declined, losing more than 2.4% of its value.</p>



<p>This year has witnessed a stunning <strong>156% acquisition</strong> in the value of the most popular digital currency, Bitcoin. The primary cause for these changes is the conjecture that the launch of ETFs could generate a new wave of demand. Undoubtedly, not all of this can be considered entirely beneficial because there is a lot of speculation in the market on whether or not the approval of these ETFs would lead to profit-taking strategies. Such speculation can potentially negatively impact the shifts in the value of bitcoin.</p>



<p><strong>CryptoQuant</strong> described what happened as a possible<em> <strong>&#8220;sell the news&#8221;</strong></em> incident, referring to the wave that formed upon the news.</p>



<p>The term used above refers to a well-known phenomenon in the capital markets: the rising sentiment, leverage, and asset prices before a positive event, followed by a sharp decline in prices.</p>



<p>This is because smart traders take advantage of overloaded long deals, ensnaring leveraged traders and pressuring them to sell out or liquidate during drops.</p>



<p>The announcement that an ETF for Bitcoin is being approved can be seen as beneficial since it allows institutions to start investing in the cryptocurrency, increasing buying pressure.</p>



<p>The memo stated that &#8220;Bitcoin short holders are experiencing an unrealistic 30% profit margin, which has historically been before price corrections (areas marked with red circles).&#8221; Furthermore, short-term holders keep spending Bitcoin profitably, and returns typically materialize once short-term losses are realized.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h2>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">ETF Approval: What to Expect from Bitcoin?</h1>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Bitcoin has recently declined, losing 2.4% of its value, and is currently trading at $42,400</li>



<li>2023 has witnessed a stunning 156% acquisition in Bitcoin&#8217;s value</li>



<li>The main cause of this decline can be the conjecture of the launch of ETFs and the newly generated wave of demand.</li>



<li>Bitcoin short holders are experiencing an unrealistic 30% profit margin.</li>



<li>CryptoQuant described what happened as a possible &#8220;sell the news&#8221; incident, referring to the wave that formed upon the news.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Justice Department is investigating Binance Holdings, the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency exchange. Primarily, this is to determine whether it violated economic sanctions imposed on Russia. According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-05/binance-faces-us-probe-of-possible-russian-sanctions-violations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg</a>, the probe is examining whether the exchange or its employees breached the sanctions put in place due to Moscow&#8217;s military actions in Ukraine. Despite the allegations, Binance insists that it follows all US and international sanctions. On the other hand, the Russian authorities have made official statements on how they have planned to curb sanctions using cryptocurrencies.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Learn <a href="https://hi.exchange/blog/exchange-cryptocurrency-to-paypal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How to Exchange Cryptocurrency to PayPal</a></p></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-binance-exchange-and-compliance-with-sanctions"><strong>Binance Exchange and Compliance with Sanctions</strong></h2>



<p>Binance claims that it has implemented an initiative to revamp its corporate governance structure and transform its global operations. The exchange also states that it has a know-your-customer (KYC) process that rivals that of traditional banking systems. Its KYC process includes a mandatory disclosure of residence and personal identification checks. The company takes a zero-tolerance approach to double registrations, anonymous identities, and obscure sources of funds.</p>



<p>“In 2021, Binance launched an initiative to completely overhaul its corporate governance structure, including bringing in a world-class bench of seasoned executives to fundamentally change how Binance operates globally.”</p>



<p>Back in 2021, Binance pledged to abide by EU’s ruling on <a href="https://hi.exchange/blog/binance-russian-sanctions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Russian sanctions</a>. Despite that, the Justice Department will not make baseless accusations on such critical matters. For the most part, it would be interesting to see what evidence the DOJ holds on Binance exchange.</p>



<p>Based on the report, the investigation is looking into whether the exchange or some of its employees helped Russia with supplying money for their operations in Ukraine. This is according to five anonymous sources.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Binance&#8217;s Struggles with Regulators</strong></h2>



<p>Binance has faced numerous allegations from US regulators and authorities in recent years. Although many of the claims were unsubstantiated, the exchange has been under scrutiny. Earlier this year, anti-crypto Senator Elizabeth Warren and other officials wrote an open letter to Binance asking for various information from the firm. They alleged that the exchange was facilitating illicit activity by intentionally concealing its activities.</p>



<p>Binance exchange responded to the claims made by the senators, stating that most of the information was taken from inaccurate media reports. The exchange denies allegations of violating sanctions against Russia and insists that it adheres to all US and international sanctions. Binance has taken steps to address compliance concerns by revamping its corporate governance structure and enhancing its KYC process.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Walking a Thin Line</strong>&#8230;</h2>



<p>Being the world’s largest crypto exchange certainly has its own baggage. Back in 2021, Changpeng Zhao, the CEO of Binance exchange revealed one of the largest Ponzi schemes in the history of crypto. Essentially, Changpeng Zhao went to war with Sam Bankman-Fried and dumped all their <a href="https://hi.exchange/blog/binance-liquidates-ftx-token/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FTX token</a> holdings. Within a matter of days, the <a href="https://hi.exchange/blog/ftx-collapse/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FTX collapsed</a> and a vast majority of investors lost their assets overnight. Soon after the collapse, countless sources revealed how SBF had strong ties with the US democratic party.</p>



<p>Subsequently, Binance exchange has found itself in the middle of a political war. With that, it is only natural for the regulators to probe into their operations and look for something. Now, while Changpeng Zhao revealed a true scam operation, it doesn’t mean that Binance is without fault. Considering the scale of their operations, one can safely assume that they have certainly slipped more than a few times.</p>



<p>And in case of Russian sanctions and all the crimes against humanity charges on Russian authorities, even a small proof that they helped Russia with their sanctions can have devastating repercussions for Binance exchange. But that’s not all.</p>



<p>In case the investigation manages to convict Binance, we could expect even more restrictive <a href="https://hi.exchange/blog/crypto-regulations-sec-cftc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">crypto regulations</a>. &nbsp;While Changpeng Zhao shrugs off the serious charges against them as simply “FUD”, Binance exchange is facing life or death situation as the lawsuits against them keep stacking up.</p>

<p>The role of cryptocurrency in the failures of banks Silvergate, Silicon Valley, and Signature has been highlighted in a recent <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IN/IN12148" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a> by the Congressional Research Service (CRS). The report examines the impact of crypto on the US banking crisis and reveals that the banks&#8217; exposure to crypto was minimal, but the perception of risk &#8220;may have driven non-crypto firms/individuals to make significant withdrawals.&#8221; Interestingly, the statement sheds light on a critical issue regarding crypto assets. Despite all the bullish predictions, the failure of crypto-friendly banks outlines the severe lack of trust in crypto still dominant among retail investors.</p>



<p>Learn <a href="https://hi.exchange/blog/exchange-cryptocurrency-to-paypal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How to Exchange Cryptocurrency to PayPal</a></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Limited Exposure to Crypto</strong></h2>



<p>According to analyst Paul Tierno from CRS, the banks&#8217; exposure to crypto &#8220;was somewhat limited.&#8221; Tierno noted that &#8220;volatility in crypto markets may expose banks to liquidity risks that could ultimately lead to fatal losses.&#8221; However, it was the dwindling deposits from crypto firms that led banks to sell securities at a loss, exacerbating liquidity issues and solvency.</p>



<p>In November 2021, the crypto market reached an all-time high of around $3 trillion. However, by December 2022, the market lost more than two-thirds of its market capitalization. The report highlighted that the fall in digital asset prices led to centralized crypto platforms and stablecoin issuers experiencing redemptions, causing them to draw down deposits held at these banks.</p>



<p>To meet the withdrawal demand, banks sold securities for losses, affecting their liquidity and, in some cases, solvency. For instance, Silvergate&#8217;s deposits fell by over half, while Signature&#8217;s deposits dropped by 15% in Q4 2022. The CRS report emphasized that the losses were not realized on crypto-related assets but were caused by crypto deposit withdrawals.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="703" src="https://hi.exchange/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/US-Banking-Crisis.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-6431" srcset="https://hi.exchange/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/US-Banking-Crisis.jpg 1024w, https://hi.exchange/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/US-Banking-Crisis-300x206.jpg 300w, https://hi.exchange/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/US-Banking-Crisis-768x527.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-crypto-s-impact-on-us-banking-crisis"><strong>Crypto’s Impact on US Banking Crisis</strong></h2>



<p>The CRS report reminds us that the crypto market chaos affected US bank stocks. SVB, Silvergate, and Signature were pushed over the edge by fear, uncertainty, and doubt. The report concluded that &#8220;banks must be prepared for the potential of rapid withdrawal of deposits. This can exacerbate liquidity issues and, ultimately, threaten solvency.&#8221;</p>



<p>In conclusion, the CRS report serves as a reminder that the crypto market&#8217;s volatility can impact US banks. Although the banks&#8217; exposure to crypto was limited, the perception of risk was enough to drive non-crypto firms/individuals to make significant withdrawals, leading to the banks selling securities at a loss. This affected their liquidity and, in some cases, their solvency. </p>



<p>However, it’s also important to analyze the fear and the lack of trust in crypto. Perhaps, the volatility is the key factor here. Yet, the <a href="https://hi.exchange/blog/ftx-collapse/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FTX collapse</a>, may have been a big wake up call for investors. Portraying how easy it is to run a multi-billion dollar scam, Sam Bankman-Fried may have permanently stained the face of crypto. considering this congressional report, we can see how limited exposure to crypto can have negative effects on their business. With all that in mind, we can see how banks may be hesitant to integrate crypto asset into their systems.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Cryptocurrency regulations have been a hot topic in recent years, with governments and regulatory agencies around the world grappling with how to approach this rapidly evolving industry. In the United States, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) plays a key role in regulating the cryptocurrency market. For the most part, the SEC has been showing an anti-crypto attitude. However, Commissioner Hester Peirce, a well-known advocate for innovation in the crypto space, has recently <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-rendering-inovation-2023-04-12" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">voiced her dissent</a> against Chair Gary Gensler&#8217;s anti-crypto agenda. Of course, we can be sure about an upcoming shock wave of regulatory action coming for crypto. However, recent debates show how there is internal conflict within the SEC regarding crypto assets.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Learn <a href="https://hi.exchange/blog/exchange-cryptocurrency-to-paypal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How to Exchange Cryptocurrency to PayPal</a></p></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Commissioner Pierce on Cryptocurrency Regulations</strong></h2>



<p>In a recent speech, Commissioner Peirce criticized the SEC&#8217;s proposal to adjust the definition of &#8220;exchange&#8221; to include decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. According to Peirce, this change would be counterproductive, promoting stagnation and centralization rather than embracing the potential of new technology.</p>



<p>&#8220;Stagnation, centralization, expatriation, and extinction are the watchwords of this release. Rather than embracing the promise of new technology as we have done in the past, here we propose to embrace stagnation, force centralization, urge expatriation, and welcome extinction of new technology. Accordingly, I dissent,&#8221; said Peirce.</p>



<p>Commissioner Peirce further highlighted that the SEC&#8217;s proposal could potentially violate the First Amendment protections by categorizing blockchain ecosystems as a &#8220;group,&#8221; creating ambiguity around their speech rights.</p>



<p>&#8220;The release&#8217;s ambiguity undermines fundamental First Amendment protections. Because the release makes everybody involved in the relevant blockchain ecosystem part of a &#8216;group,&#8217; it creates significant ambiguity around what speech requires government pre-approval, which will unavoidably chill constitutionally-protected speech,&#8221; Peirce explained.</p>



<p>Peirce also emphasized the importance of the SEC remaining open to the idea of tweaking its rules to accommodate new technologies, something she believes the Commission understood in the 1990s.</p>



<p>&#8220;The Commission of the 1990s understood this basic principle and created space for significant innovations in securities trading. This release, on the other hand, takes the view that any business model that cannot meet the specific requirements of our existing regulatory model does not belong in our markets,&#8221; Peirce stated.</p>



<p>In essence, Peirce argues that the SEC&#8217;s current approach to cryptocurrency regulations is hindering innovation and preventing cutting-edge businesses from entering the market. She believes that a Commission serious about regulating, rather than destroying, the cryptocurrency market should reflect on its past regulatory failures and be open to adapting its rules to accommodate the unique characteristics of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-sec-s-iron-fist"><strong>The SEC’s Iron Fist</strong></h2>



<p>Peirce&#8217;s dissenting voice within the SEC sheds light on the internal conflict within the regulatory agency regarding how to approach cryptocurrency regulations. Chair Gary Gensler has taken a more stringent stance on cryptocurrencies, expressing concerns about investor protection and market integrity. On the other hand, Commissioner Peirce has been a vocal advocate for embracing innovation and allowing the cryptocurrency market to flourish.</p>



<p>The debate over cryptocurrency regulations is not limited to the SEC. Governments and regulatory agencies worldwide are grappling with how to effectively regulate the rapidly growing cryptocurrency market. Some countries have taken a more progressive approach, recognizing the potential of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, while others have adopted a more cautious stance, expressing concerns about risks such as money laundering and fraud.</p>



<p>In the United States, the lack of clear and consistent cryptocurrency regulations has created uncertainty for businesses and investors operating in the crypto space. Many argue that a well-regulated cryptocurrency market could provide significant benefits, such as increased investor protection, market transparency, and economic growth. However, excessive regulation could stifle innovation and hinder the development of the cryptocurrency market.</p>



<p>The SEC, as a key regulatory agency in the U.S., plays a crucial role in shaping cryptocurrency regulations. Commissioner Peirce&#8217;s dissenting voice highlights the need for a balanced and pragmatic approach to regulating cryptocurrencies. While it is important to address risks and protect investors, paralyzing a whole industry does not sound like a democratic approach either.</p>

<p>It’s 2023 and “Twitter logo change” is trending everywhere! So if you’re struggling with your student loans like I do, just know that Dogecoin whales got rich yesterday. Not to say that Elon orchestrated a DOGE pump and dump, but it seems like he totally did. Recent on-chain data shows that two of the largest Dogecoin whales dumped all their holdings as DOGE peaked. In total, two whales unloaded over a billion tokens right at the top of the rally initiated by Elon. In the meantime, Musk is facing a huge lawsuit for allegedly running a <a href="https://hi.exchange/blog/dogecoin-pyramid-sheme-elon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dogecoin pyramid scheme</a>. It’s 2023 and post-modernism is taking over the world of finance. Let us laugh together at how funny it was to see the Twitter logo change to DOGE logo. LOL!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Fly Me to the Moon Elon!</strong></h2>



<p>Lookonchain, a blockchain-tracking firm, recently <a href="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1644172110418550785" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that the third and fifth largest Dogecoin holders, known as &#8220;DDuX&#8221; and &#8220;D8ZE,&#8221; respectively, sold off a combined 1.4 billion DOGE (about $123.8 million) during a surge in the dog-themed cryptocurrency by around 30%. Interestingly, this rally coincided with Tesla CEO and tech billionaire Elon Musk changing Twitter&#8217;s icon to the DOGE logo. Now, journalists of the past would dive deep into this story and attempt to find out whether this was a coincidence or not. But, as Elon’s lawyers have already addressed this behavior as simply “too vague and silly”, there’s no point arguing with them. Perhaps, Elon himself duped some DOGE and bailed out one of his companies. Or, it was yet another vague and silly joketo lighten up the mood.</p>



<p>According to Lookonchain, &#8220;DDuX&#8221; sold off a whopping 1.1 billion DOGE ($95.2 million) in two separate transactions on April 4th and April 5th, when DOGE was trading at around $0.09. Talk about making a splash in the crypto sea! Meanwhile, &#8220;D8ZE&#8221; sold 300 million DOGE ($28.6 million) in a series of transactions on April 4th, 5th, and 6th, all at the $0.09 level. Looks like these whales were cashing in on the Dogecoin frenzy, riding the wave of Musk&#8217;s endorsement. Then again, the Twitter logo change was just a funny joke.</p>



<p>What&#8217;s even more interesting is that &#8220;DDuX&#8221; and &#8220;D8ZE&#8221; are the two largest non-exchange DOGE holders, as per <a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-dogecoin-addresses.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BitInfoCharts</a>. It seems like these crypto whales were making a big splash in the DOGE market, making moves that caught the attention of investors and traders alike. But hey, with great DOGE comes great responsibility, right?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-twitter-logo-change">The Twitter Logo Change</h2>



<p>Adding to the drama, Musk&#8217;s Twitter icon change to the DOGE logo was a brief but attention-grabbing move. As the most famous supporter of Dogecoin, Musk&#8217;s actions often influence the cryptocurrency market. But was it a mere coincidence that these DOGE whales were cashing out while Musk was playing with Twitter logos?</p>



<p>In the midst of all this excitement, Musk is also facing a $258 billion lawsuit that alleges he illegally drove up the price of DOGE by over 36,000% over the span of two years before letting it collapse. Talk about a rollercoaster ride! Looks like the Dogecoin drama is not just limited to its price fluctuations, but also involves some legal battles and Twitter shenanigans.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>Ultimately, the recent events involving Dogecoin whales cashing out, Elon Musk&#8217;s Twitter logo change, and the ongoing lawsuit create quite a whale of a story in the world of cryptocurrencies. The DOGE market is never short of drama and surprises. Thankfully, DOGE holders and traders don’t really have to know anything about finance. All they have to do is to buy Dogecoin and wait for Elon to joke around! After all, in the crypto ocean, whales can make waves that can impact the entire ecosystem. So, keep an eye on those whales, and buckle up for the next chapter in the Dogecoin saga! And hey, maybe next time Musk changes his Twitter icon, it&#8217;s time to keep an eye on those DOGE prices too, with a pinch of humor and sarcasm, of course!</p>

<p>There is a literary theory called formalism which is pretty boring but has a practical message. One should take everything at face value instead of acknowledging endless extrinsic benefactors. Now, taking Elon’s clownery on Twitter at face value, he was undoubtedly promoting a Dogecoin pyramid scheme. But guess what, nobody can prove it just like nobody can prove Epstein didn’t kill himself. Today, the world of finance is taking a serious beating from social media due to well-coordinated pumps and dumps. And Elon, standing on top of the world, is running his own Dogecoin pyramid scheme to compensate for all of his far-fetched projects. After all, someone has to raise trillions of dollars to send humans to mars where extreme solar radiation will give you cancer. However, one investor has sued Elon and his companies for a lot of money and all we can say to him is Godspeed!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><mark style="background-color:#ffffff" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">Buy and Sell Dogecoin Instantly on <a href="http://www.hi.exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jolixo</a><br>No KYC</mark></p></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dogecoin-pyramid-scheme"><strong>Dogecoin Pyramid Scheme</strong></h2>



<p>Ha ha it’s so funny, Elon posted a meme on Twitter. Welp, Keith Johnson doesn’t think so. Mr. Johnson has bravely sued the meme mongering clown billionaire and his companies for a fair $258 billion. Basically, he is claiming that they promoted a Dogecoin pyramid scheme with their support for DOGE.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://assets2.pacermonitor.com/filings/Johnson_v_Musk_et_al/Johnson_v_Musk_et_al__nysdce-22-05037__0001.0.pdf?X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjELn%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEaCXVzLWVhc3QtMSJHMEUCICe8v9QbE5ucxkNw%2F4uIyKQkjJprelAClmtWXaGaR63yAiEAmtTds26Or20TjflZQuFt8E5KHvARjGVAJVpAzkBd4iYq3AQIwv%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FARADGgw5MjQ2NTE0MDgzOTgiDHdleGUYt3IzNA4WxCqwBMxc7LYGv%2F3FmkzepvB1iEhKy4WrV60iR%2BC6sgRWd7KRvpeKutlBGRhY%2BSpmfSN2P5eTxK1sprMAOk4RMJbwXMB2IwFCatBro0IJPS26eMo3TpqDLwCVQAfqVqTxlvqdgOv%2Fvesj6yET6XWuPEY08iW2ZbF%2F9fqXXy3ujKokd2%2BOMPORrbBGZ3wYx5E1Ux7GsuU7a55EJfmihcgkf22mcb2yW%2F25nolZn26PATe1SVfwfc%2BJPOFpch%2BpIDZDINfzNgnYW%2BNc60KcB%2FWBluXiuINNUw%2FqBPcx4FgwyAyTTt0%2BbPFpQnYc%2FzQ9XDwgOOge%2FK8mT3q3svyKADAW4LOmGnjxCMshOnxLrcWVA5pdQT6Xp1V56%2Br%2BSXD986u3EHnCTGoTiIP311bCYq1o4pcpjdcrCZE%2F%2F3rtF%2FehTr%2By3Iy9%2FdH3Dbp4RUl7%2BP16eOQvUeCCEukWX8M9OgFLYcvrdsAox1l%2Fw%2FUQ3dfLYpia7fVObcoo%2FRUN8ak85FMqBkgyKGB7mfCqDLM6vU%2Bw5Hianz3hWo9WuCcTEvKsqv%2FY6L0rIAC1uFw%2FC%2F4%2F%2Bs3qDpJhu%2BnvZGCCGv9%2FVPfjwvAI9XcQ6%2Bc2TC7kx5%2BPm7PyY0SKBM5C4a6JTMPcKog44sq9HTTeMawq1fBvsbBITYxKmjxRuE4rFCn2seFta5Elc54qv1Y0X5P0oQkjOESiNWyArByjoh4KLwtS9xiAA9Uh5Av0sFrFeGm5LKvXQaQz5YXAMOG6rZUGOqkB0oSanITZYUmLZlbgCjFCckfK8%2FTGfAR1DMznAy%2FFM1HNAh9Bi6glBFifnM68QF9sBoXrOZOICHPvTnPyEPQjClub0Bg1Fj9%2BH%2FL3rYsdeci303GLJtGoeuG5dMfIQI9hzTVw7qOi81%2FF68mt0OeLODNJNcw2j1nyQmb8%2FfWKut0BOzkDDZIchN9jIbI3ViOdimrq960jFJj7YVWSOD%2FrDKyHANsocddz9A%3D%3D&amp;X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Date=20220616T172931Z&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;X-Amz-Expires=599&amp;X-Amz-Credential=ASIA5OSMEZQHHGKLHKVM%2F20220616%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Signature=e89dbab48532f1335e571cea705859ffa86dd08c2139a572d86c7cdbfb8c62c4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">court documents</a>, Keith Johnson argues that Dogecoin is “simply a fraud whereby greater fools are deceived into buying a coin at a higher price. The documents are currently held with the US district court in southern district of New York.</p>



<p>Johnson is calling for the court to clarify the case as a class-action lawsuit. With that, he is asking for $86 billion in damages for the class, as well as $172 billion for treble damages.</p>



<p>Initially, Keith Johnson argues that Elon and his companies utilized “unethical, torturous and criminal conduct in promoting Dogecoin. Hence, billions of investors lost billions of dollars into the Dogecoin pyramid scheme. As for the numbers, Johnson states that musk made $86 billion “as a result of their wire fraud, gambling enterprise, false advertising, deceptive practices, and other unlawful conduct.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Too Vague, and Silly!</h2>



<p>Billionaire Elon Musk is seeking to have the multi-billion-dollar lawsuit against him dismissed, which alleges he illegally promoted Dogecoin pyramid scheme. The lawsuit, which was filed by a group of investors, accuses Musk of perpetrating a scandal.</p>



<p>Attorneys representing the Tesla CEO are arguing that the lawsuit is baseless, and Musk&#8217;s statements about Dogecoin were too vague and silly to be considered actual endorsements of the cryptocurrency. Additionally, the lawyers contend that DOGE is a legitimate cryptocurrency with a market cap of around $10 billion. </p>



<p>Musk&#8217;s legal team stated, &#8220;There is nothing unlawful about tweeting words of support for or funny pictures about a legitimate cryptocurrency that continues to hold a market cap of nearly $10 billion. This court should dismiss the complaint and put a stop to plaintiffs&#8217; fantasy.&#8221; this statement matters a lot. Because apparently the court is dealing with a bunch of 12 year olds in this lawsuit!</p>



<p>The lawsuit filed by investors claims that Musk purposely drove the price of Dogecoin up by 36,000% over a two-year period before letting it crash. The suit also alleges that Dogecoin was a security, and Musk knew that it had no intrinsic value.</p>



<p>In addition, the Dogecoin Foundation is another defendant in the lawsuit and is also seeking to have it dismissed.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-elongate"><strong>Elongate</strong></h2>



<p>Elon may be the richest man on earth, but, almost all of his wealth is tied up in stocks for his companies. And, ding ding ding, all his stocks are holding the biggest bubbles in history. Don’t believe it? Then why would Bill gates hold a $2-billion-dollar short position on Tesla? Despite Elon’s wealth, his companies are constantly desperate for cash flow because bubbles take lots of money to continue.</p>



<p>Previously, Elon has stated that he holds Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and Dogecoin (DOGE). To make it more interesting, he had previously <a href="https://blog.hi.exchange/elon-musk-says-the-us-should-do-nothing-about-crypto/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> that the US lawmakers should “do nothing” about crypto.</p>



<p>As to why he loves DOGE, he had said that it is the “people’s crypto”. You would think that in this day and age, communist style of deception would not work but you would be wrong. Today, everything is “people’s thing” everyone is doing it for “the people” just like the gulags were for the “people”.</p>



<p>In the world of insane maximalists and mislead retail investors, Elon’s Dogecoin pyramid scheme was an unfair one. While the current bear market is purging market from all the crazy NFT money and stimulus checks, Elon will continue to take from “the people”.</p>
