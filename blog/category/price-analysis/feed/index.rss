<p>Lark Davis &#8211; the well-known audacious researcher and forecaster of renowned digital currency analysts &#8211; ecstatic digital currency enthusiasts and investors regarding his prediction of Ethereum in 2024.</p>



<p>In his most recent YouTube video, Davis dug into the untapped potential of Ethereum and insisted that crypto bases are the way to get rich with Ethereum. However, this is by no means an easy or straightforward path.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe title="Ethereum Will Make Millionaires In 2024, BUT Not How You Think" width="800" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dYiBe72ww6k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Ethereum price path in 2024</h2>



<p>According to Davis, Ethereum can reach $10,000 to $15,000. He emphasizes that simply buying and holding Ethereum is not a golden ticket to wealth. At Ethereum&#8217;s current price of $2,295, investors are likely to see a 600% return, which is very remarkable. But Davis points to more lucrative opportunities.</p>



<p>There are fundamental financial changes in Ethereum layer two solutions. Networks built on top of Ethereum to increase its scalability and efficiency. He emphasizes that these layer two platforms, such as StarkNet, ZK Sync, and others, are much more than Ethereum. They cause the explosive growth of the price of this currency.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Prospects for 2024 Ethereum price growth</h2>



<p>According to Davis, these Layer 2 networks should be monitored for new token listings. He mentions Celestia as an example, which witnessed a 500% gain just one month after going public. Keeping an eye on these new listings can be significant for people hoping to make substantial earnings rapidly.</p>



<p>Davis also highlights the possibility of airdrops in the Layer 2 space. He shares details on how to take part in these airdrops by chain activities and staking, such as the Manta Network and zkSync programs. Compared to conventional ETH investments, these airdrops have the potential to be more profitable, more immediate, and generate greater returns.</p>



<p>The value of the largest altcoin was $2,295 at the time of publication. A few analysts expect it to increase to $2,500 in the final five days of the year. The weekly and daily charts for Ethereum are currently showing green, and the Fear and Greed indicator is shifting in favor of Greed, indicating strong bullishness. Furthermore, Ether is anticipated to be among the leaders of the anticipated uptrend in 2024.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Despite the most recent changes regarding the Bitcoin ETF, the landscape of virtual currencies is once more in the midst of a profound shift. The most valuable cryptocurrency in the world of digital assets, Bitcoin, has recently declined, losing more than 2.4% of its value.</p>



<p>This year has witnessed a stunning <strong>156% acquisition</strong> in the value of the most popular digital currency, Bitcoin. The primary cause for these changes is the conjecture that the launch of ETFs could generate a new wave of demand. Undoubtedly, not all of this can be considered entirely beneficial because there is a lot of speculation in the market on whether or not the approval of these ETFs would lead to profit-taking strategies. Such speculation can potentially negatively impact the shifts in the value of bitcoin.</p>



<p><strong>CryptoQuant</strong> described what happened as a possible<em> <strong>&#8220;sell the news&#8221;</strong></em> incident, referring to the wave that formed upon the news.</p>



<p>The term used above refers to a well-known phenomenon in the capital markets: the rising sentiment, leverage, and asset prices before a positive event, followed by a sharp decline in prices.</p>



<p>This is because smart traders take advantage of overloaded long deals, ensnaring leveraged traders and pressuring them to sell out or liquidate during drops.</p>



<p>The announcement that an ETF for Bitcoin is being approved can be seen as beneficial since it allows institutions to start investing in the cryptocurrency, increasing buying pressure.</p>



<p>The memo stated that &#8220;Bitcoin short holders are experiencing an unrealistic 30% profit margin, which has historically been before price corrections (areas marked with red circles).&#8221; Furthermore, short-term holders keep spending Bitcoin profitably, and returns typically materialize once short-term losses are realized.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h2>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">ETF Approval: What to Expect from Bitcoin?</h1>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Bitcoin has recently declined, losing 2.4% of its value, and is currently trading at $42,400</li>



<li>2023 has witnessed a stunning 156% acquisition in Bitcoin&#8217;s value</li>



<li>The main cause of this decline can be the conjecture of the launch of ETFs and the newly generated wave of demand.</li>



<li>Bitcoin short holders are experiencing an unrealistic 30% profit margin.</li>



<li>CryptoQuant described what happened as a possible &#8220;sell the news&#8221; incident, referring to the wave that formed upon the news.</li>

<p>Once again, Bitcoin price failed to surpass $20,000. It is likely for BTC to have another correction. However, the $18,900 support Is currently too strong. Here is a summary of Bitcoin price in the past 24 hours:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><a href="/Users/Admin/Desktop/Work/Coinbase%20Exchange%20Sold%20User%20Data%20to%20ICE%20(Shocking)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Exchange Bitcoin to PayPal</a> on CoinCannon</p></blockquote></figure>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Bitcoin price failed to break through $20,000.</li><li>Currently, the price is below $19,400 and the 1-hour candles are below the SMA100.</li><li>On the 1-hour chart, we see a new downtrend forming with resistance at $19,250.</li><li>BTC is likely to move toward $18,900 in short-term.</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bitcoin Price Action Analysis</strong></h2>



<p>With a recovery, Bitcoin managed to move above $19,500 and at some point reached $19,800. However, the sellers took control and pushed BTC down. With that, BTC climbed only as high as $19,939 and then had a correction.</p>



<p>Subsequently, the price lost the $19,500 and $19,400. The sellers brought BTC down below the 50% Fibonacci retracement level from the latest rally from $18,271 to $19,939. At the moment, BTC is trading below $19,400 and the 1-hour candles are below the SMA100. On the 1-hour chart, we see a new downtrend forming with resistance at $19,250.</p>



<p>The $19,220 is the first resistance for BTC followed closely by $19,250. Breaking through this level can pump BTC back above $19,500. Despite that, the primary resistance is still the $20,000. Further growth can push the price all the way up to $21,200.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if Bitcoin price fails to surpass $19,250, the correction will continue. In which case, the $19,000 is a key support level followed closely by $18,900. This level is close to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level from the latest rise. Dipping below $18,900 can increase the selling pressure and bring BTC down to $18,500.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Technical Indicators</strong></h2>



<p>MACD indicator: at the time of writing this article the 1-hour MACD indicator for BTC is on a downward momentum.</p>



<p>RSI: the 1-hour relative strength index is currently at 50.</p>



<p>Resistance levels: Right now, the $19,250, $20,000 and $20,500 are crucial resistance levels for BTC.</p>



<p>Support levels: The $18,900 is currently the key support level for the price.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bitcoin Price Action Analysis</strong></h2>



<p>BTC took a downturn at $20,200 and moved below critical support levels at $20,000 and $19,800. Furthermore, the sellers took Bitcoin down below $19,500 and the SMA100. The lowest recorded price in the past few hours has been $19,249 before having a minor recovery. With that, BTC took back $19,500 and broke through the $19,450 which is on a downtrend on the 1-hour chart. Subsequently, the price touched the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level from the latest all from $20,443 to $19,249. Currently, BTC is trading below $20,000 and the 1-hour candles are below the SMA100.</p>



<p>The fist resistance level for BTC is at $19,550 followed by $19,700 on the SMA100. Closing above$19,700 can bring the price closer to 50% Fibonacci which is very bullish. In which case, the price could quickly approach $20,000 and then regain $20,500.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if Bitcoin price fails to surpass $19,700, the downtrend will continue. For this scenario, the $19,400 is the first support followed by $19,250. Dipping below $19,250 can bring Bitcoin down to $18,500 support.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bitcoin Price Action Analysis</strong></h2>



<p>Bitcoin price stabilized below $19,000 and lost the $18,500 support then reached a low of $18,223. Despite that, it did not test the $18,000 support since the buyers rose to support it.</p>



<p>Subsequently, BTC took back $18,500 and $18,800. Then, it moved above the 50% Fibonacci retracement level from the latest fall from $20,198 to $18,223. It even had a spike up to $19,500 but once again the sellers took back control on the SMA100. On the 1-hour chart, we see a new downtrend forming with resistance at $19,650. This level is right on the 76.4% Fibonacci retracement level from the latest dip.</p>



<p>The $19,600 is the first resistance level for Bitcoin followed by the key level at $20,000. Further growth can push BTC up to $20,500. Furthermore, if the buyers remain strong, BTC can touch $21,200.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if Bitcoin price fails to surpass $19,600, there could be a new downtrend. In which case, the $19,200 will be the first support level followed by $18,850. Losing the $18,850 and $18,500 can bring the price down to $18,223 and lower.</p>

<p>Bitcoin price is hovering above $22,000 level in the green zone. In case BTC surpassed $22,500, it could potentially form a new rally. Here is a summary of Bitcoin price in the past 24 hours:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><mark style="background-color:#ffffff" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color"><a href="/Users/Admin/Desktop/Work/Coinbase%20Exchange%20Sold%20User%20Data%20to%20ICE%20(Shocking)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Exchange Bitcoin to PayPal</a> on CoinCannon</mark></p></blockquote></figure>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Bitcoin has stabilized above $21,500 and $22,000.</li><li>Currently, the price is above $22,000 and the 1-hour candles are above the SMA100.</li><li>On the 1-hour chart, we see a new uptrend forming with support level at $21,800.</li><li>At the moment, BTC is having a slight correction and could likely form a new rally at above $22,500.</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bitcoin Price Action Analysis</strong></h2>



<p>BTC could finally surpass $21,500 and $22,000 levels with the support coming from buyers. With that, the price stabilized above $22,000 and the SMA100. Subsequently, Bitcoin price reached a high of $22,473 and went for a correction. Consequently, BTC dipped below $22,200 and penetrated below the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level from the latest growth from $21,180 to $22,473. Currently, the price is above $22,000 and the 1-hour candles are above the SMA100. On the 1-hour chart, we see a new uptrend forming with support at $21,800.</p>



<p>The first resistance for BTC is at $22,450 followed closely by $22,500. Breaking through $22,500 will likely cause further growth. In which case, the $23,200 will be the next resistance level and would pave the way to reach $24,000.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if Bitcoin price fails to surpass $22,500, there could be further correction ahead. For this scenario, the $22,000 will be the first support level followed by $21,800. This level is near the 50% Fibonacci retracement level from the latest rise. Dipping below $21,500 can push BTC further down to $21,000.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bitcoin Price Action Analysis</strong></h2>



<p>Bitcoin was unable to break through the $20,500 and $20,550 levels and took a downturn. Subsequently, it made multiple failed attempts to surpass but failed. Then, the price dipped below $19,500 and entered the red zone. By losing the $19,500 and the SMA100, the downtrend gained momentum and lost the $19,200 and $19,000. The 24-hour low for BTC is at $18,736. Furthermore, BTC has moved below the $50% Fibonacci retracement level at $19,420. Currently, the $19,420 and $19,800 are key resistance levels to beat.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if Bitcoin price fails to moved back above $19,000 and start a recovery, further decline will follow. In which case, the $18,650 and $18,500 are the first support levels for the price. Dipping below $18,500 could pave the way for a quick plunge. For this scenario, BTC could hit a low of $18,000.</p>

<p>Bitcoin price failed to surpass $20,000 and turned back down. Currently, BTC is making a weak recovery attempt and in case of surpassing $19,800, it could move to regain $20k. However, it is likely for sellers to push the price down at $20,000. Here is a summary of Bitcoin price in the past 24 hours:</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>BTC failed to surpass $20,000 and dipped as low as $19,600.</li><li>Currently, the price is below $20,000 and the 1-hour candles are below the SMA100.</li><li>On the 1-hour chart, we see a new downtrend forming with resistance at $19,800.</li><li>On the same chart, we see a new channel forming with resistance at $20,450.</li><li>In case of surpassing the $19,800 and $20,000, BTC could move to break the ceiling.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bitcoin Price Action Analysis</strong></h2>



<p>Bitcoin price had some support at $19,750 but failed to break through $20,000 and the SMA100. Subsequently, it dipped and lost the $19,800 level and hit a 24-h low of $19,600. After that, BTC set to recover and is currently trading below $20,000 and the SMA100. On the 1-hour chart, we see a new downtrend forming with resistance at $19,800. On the same chart, we also have a new channel forming with resistance at $20,450.</p>



<p>The first resistance level for BTC is at $20,800 which is on the downtrend. Following that, the $20,000 level on the SMA100 will be the next resistance level. Breaking through $20,000 could pave the way for further short-term growth. In which case, the $20,200 and $20,450 will be next in line. By then, the $20,750 near the 50% Fibonacci retracement level is a critical resistance level. Last but not least, the $21,000 is a key resistance level for Bitcoin.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if Bitcoin price fails to surpass $19,800 and $20,000, it would approach the bottom of the channel. For this scenario, the $19,600, $19,520 and $19,500 will be the next support levels. Then, the $19,450 will be the next support for BTC. Further decline can bring about a new downtrend. Likely, the $19,200 and $18,900 will be the next support levels.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bitcoin Price Action Analysis</strong></h2>



<p>Bitcoin finally surpassed the $20,000 level after hours of ranging with a recovery attempt. However, the sellers pushed it back down at $20,400 and BTC lost the $20,200 and $20,000 levels. The lowest recorder price in the past 24 hours has been $19,750 and this is where BTC bounced back. At the moment, Bitcoin is trading below the $20,400 and the 1-hour candles are below the SMA100. On the 1-hour chart, we see a new channel forming with resistance at $20,430.</p>



<p>The first resistance level for BTC is at $20,000 followed closely by $20,100 and the SM100. Further growth can potentially push BTC up to $20,200 and $20,350. After that, the $20,430 and $20,480 will be the next resistance levels. With a successful breakthrough from $20,500, BTC could possible reach $21,000 in short-term.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if Bitcoin price fails to surpass $20,000, it would move toward the bottom of the channel. In which case, the $19,800 will be the first support level followed by $19,650. Further decline can bring BTC down to $19,550 and $19,520. By dipping below $19,500, the price could quickly fall down to $18,500.</p>

<p>Bitcoin price is currently consolidating around $20,000. In case BTC manages to surpass $20,550, there could be a significant recovery pattern ahead. Here is a summary of Bitcoin price in the past 24 hours:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><mark style="background-color:#ffffff" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color"><a href="/Users/Admin/Desktop/Work/Coinbase%20Exchange%20Sold%20User%20Data%20to%20ICE%20(Shocking)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Exchange Bitcoin to PayPal</a> on CoinCannon</mark></p></blockquote></figure>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Bitcoin is showing bullish signs above the $20,000 level.</li><li>Currently, the price is above $20,000 and the 1-hour candles are above the SMA100.</li><li>On the 1-hour chart, we see a new downtrend forming with resistance at $20,340.</li><li>In order to turn bullish, BTC must surpass the $20,340 and $20,550 indefinitely.</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bitcoin Price Action Analysis</strong></h2>



<p>Bitcoin had a recovery and moved back above $20,000. At some point, BTC surpassed $20,200 and the SMA100 and had a spike all the way up to $20,500. Despite that, the sellers took control and Bitcoin peaked at $20,576 before having a correction. With that, BTC fell back down below $20,000 and the SAM100 but managed to regain $19,500. The lowest recorded price in the past few hours has bee $19,555 before recovering. Subsequently, BTC moved above the 50% Fibonacci retracement level from the latest fall from $20,576 to $19,555. Currently, the price is above $20,000 and the 1-hour candles are above the SMA100.</p>



<p>The first resistance level for BTC is at $20,340. On the 1-hour chart, we see a new downtrend forming with resistance at $20,340. Furthermore, this line is also close to the 76.4% Fibonacci retracement level from the latest fall. After that, the $20,550 will be the key resistance level for BTC. Surpassing this level could bring Bitcoin up to $21,000 and ultimately the $22,000.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if Bitcoin price fails to surpass $20,550, there will be a new downtrend. In which case, the $20,000 will be the first support level followed by $19,780. Losing the $19,780 could result in a rapid decline. In that regard, continues bearish action in short-term can bring BTC all the way down to $19,500.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bitcoin Price Action Analysis</strong></h2>



<p>BTC found strong support at $19,525 and bounced back. With that, the price surpassed $19,700 and $19,800 and formed a recovery pattern. Then, it finally broke the $20,000 resistance level and a critical downtrend right on this level. Subsequently, BTC penetrated above the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level from the latest fall from $21,875 to $19,525.</p>



<p>At the moment, BTC is trading at $20,400 and is attempting to surpass the SMA100. Despite multiple efforts by the buyers to move above this line, BTC has failed so far. Currently, Bitcoin price is below $20,500 and the 1-hour candles are below the SMA100.</p>



<p>The first resistance level for Bitcoin is at $20,350 and the SMA100. After that, the $20,700 near the 50% Fibonacci retracement level will come next. Further growth can push BTC toward $21,000.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if Bitcoin price fails to surpass $20,400, there will be a new correction ahead. In which case, the $20,000 is the first support level for the price. Following that the $19,850 will be the next support level and losing it would be detrimental. For this scenario, BTC will once again go for $19,525.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bitcoin Price Action Analysis</strong></h2>



<p>BTC took a downturn starting from $23,000 and subsequently lost the $22,500 and $22,200. The price dipped below the $22,000 and even had a spike down to $21,000. With that, BTC hit a low of $20,797 and is currently above $21,000. Currently, BTC is trading below $22,000 and the 1-hour candles are below the SMA100.

<p>On the other hand, if Bitcoin price fails to surpass $22,000, the downtrend will continue. In which case, the $21,250 will be the first support level followed by $20,800. Closing below $20,800 would cause a rapid decline for BTC. For this scenario, BTC may fall as low as $20,000.</p>
