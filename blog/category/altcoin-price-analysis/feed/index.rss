<p>Lark Davis &#8211; the well-known audacious researcher and forecaster of renowned digital currency analysts &#8211; ecstatic digital currency enthusiasts and investors regarding his prediction of Ethereum in 2024.</p>



<p>In his most recent YouTube video, Davis dug into the untapped potential of Ethereum and insisted that crypto bases are the way to get rich with Ethereum. However, this is by no means an easy or straightforward path.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe title="Ethereum Will Make Millionaires In 2024, BUT Not How You Think" width="800" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dYiBe72ww6k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Ethereum price path in 2024</h2>



<p>According to Davis, Ethereum can reach $10,000 to $15,000. He emphasizes that simply buying and holding Ethereum is not a golden ticket to wealth. At Ethereum&#8217;s current price of $2,295, investors are likely to see a 600% return, which is very remarkable. But Davis points to more lucrative opportunities.</p>



<p>There are fundamental financial changes in Ethereum layer two solutions. Networks built on top of Ethereum to increase its scalability and efficiency. He emphasizes that these layer two platforms, such as StarkNet, ZK Sync, and others, are much more than Ethereum. They cause the explosive growth of the price of this currency.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Prospects for 2024 Ethereum price growth</h2>



<p>According to Davis, these Layer 2 networks should be monitored for new token listings. He mentions Celestia as an example, which witnessed a 500% gain just one month after going public. Keeping an eye on these new listings can be significant for people hoping to make substantial earnings rapidly.</p>



<p>Davis also highlights the possibility of airdrops in the Layer 2 space. He shares details on how to take part in these airdrops by chain activities and staking, such as the Manta Network and zkSync programs. Compared to conventional ETH investments, these airdrops have the potential to be more profitable, more immediate, and generate greater returns.</p>



<p>The value of the largest altcoin was $2,295 at the time of publication. A few analysts expect it to increase to $2,500 in the final five days of the year. The weekly and daily charts for Ethereum are currently showing green, and the Fear and Greed indicator is shifting in favor of Greed, indicating strong bullishness. Furthermore, Ether is anticipated to be among the leaders of the anticipated uptrend in 2024.</p>

<p>ADA price fell down to $0.43 and $0.4250 on August 28 and had support. With that, it managed to form a recovery and surpassed $0.45 and then $0.50 and settled at $0.53 on September 10. At that point, Cardano faced strong resistance and had a correction. Subsequently, the price fell down to $0.4150 and found support. By stabilizing, Cardano made another move and climbed up to $0.4350 but failed to break through. Currently, ADA price is around $0.4220.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><mark style="background-color:#ffffff" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color"><a href="https://blog.hi.exchange/exchange-cryptocurrency-to-paypal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Exchange Cryptocurrency to PayPal</a> Instantly on CoinCannon</mark></p></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>ADA Price Action Analysis</strong></h2>



<p>Taking a look at the 4-hour chart, we see ADA facing a strong resistance at $0.60 and falling down as low as $0.4150. Then, it had some support and managed to bounce back with a recovery. However, it soon failed to surpass $0.4350 and dipped as low as $0.42.</p>



<p>At this point, the $0.4150 is the first support level for Cardano. In case of good support, the price can one again make an attempt to surpass the downtrend on the chart. For that, the $0.4250 is the level to beat followed by $0.43 on the SMA100. The $0.4350 and $0.44 are the next resistance levels to follow.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if ADA price fails to surpass $0.43, there could be further correction. For the bearish scenario, the $0.42 and $0.4150 are key support levels. In case of losing them, the $0.40 and $0.38 are the following support levels.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>ADA Price Action Analysis</strong></h2>



<p>Taking a look at the 4-hour chart, we see Cardano hitting a strong ceiling at $0.60 and having to back down. After that, it lost the $0.50 and settled at $0.4250 with the new support. Subsequently, Cardano managed to bounce back and recover. With that, it went all the way up to $0.53 on September 10 but failed to break through and settled back down at $0.4350.</p>



<p>Currently, the $0.49 is a key resistance level for ADA. In case of a successful breakthrough, the $0.52 is the next resistance followed by $0.54 on the trendline. In case of stabilizing, Cardano can move toward $0.58 and $0.60.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if ADA price fails to surpass $0.50, there could be further correction. For the bearish scenario, the $0.45 is the first support level on the SMA100.

<p>BNB price faced strong resistance at $340 and had to back down. By losing the $300 and $275, Binance Coin fell down to $260 on September 6 but found support. With that, it had a chance to recover and managed to surpass $275 and $285 to reach $300. At that point, it hit a downtrend and had to once again back down to $275. Currently, BNB price is at $280.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><mark style="background-color:#ffffff" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">Exchange Binance Coin (BNB) to PayPal instantly on <a href="http://www.hi.exchange" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jolixo</a></mark></p></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>BNB Price Action Analysis</strong></h2>



<p>Taking a look at the 4-hour chart, we see BNB hitting a dead end at $340 and having to back down with a downward channel. Following that, the price continued ranging between the top and bottom and hit the bottom at $260. Subsequently, BNB managed to bounce back and recover. Binance coin surpassed $275 and $285 and peaked at $300 on September 12. Once again, the price turned back down after touching the ceiling and fell down to $275.</p>



<p>At the moment, the $275 is the first support level for BNB. In case of successful support, we expect Binance coin to continue upwards. For the bullish scenario, the $285 and then 295 on the SMA100 are the first resistance levels for the price. In case BNB breaks through the top of the channel, it could reach $300 and $310.</p>

<p>Ethereum price failed to surpass $1,700. Currently, ETH is looking bullish and can likely break above the $1,800 level. Here is a summary of Ethereum price in the past 24 hours:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><mark style="background-color:#ffffff" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color"><a href="https://blog.hi.exchange/exchange-cryptocurrency-to-paypal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Exchange Cryptocurrency to PayPal</a> on CoinCannon with Lowest Fees</mark></p></blockquote></figure>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Ethereum is set on a new rally and has stabilized above $1,700.</li><li>Currently, the price is above $1,700 and the 1-hour candles are above the SMA100.</li><li>On the 1-hour chart, we see a new uptrend forming with support level at $1,725.</li><li>In order to reach $1,800 in short-term, ETH must surpass $1,780 level.</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Ethereum Price Action Analysis</strong></h2>



<p>ETH managed to remain above the $1,650 support and set on a new rally. With that, the price moved above $1,700 and the SMA100. Consequently, ETH broke through $1,750 and reached a monthly high of $1,788.</p>



<p>At the moment, ETH is having a slight correction and has lost the $1,750 support. Furthermore, ETH has moved below the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level from the latest fall rise from $1,620 to $1,788. Currently, Ethereum price is over $1,700 and the 1-hour candles are above the SMA100. On the 1-hour chart, we see a new uptrend forming with support level at $1,725.</p>



<p>The first resistance level for the price is at $1,750 followed closely by $1,780. Breaking through $1,780can pave the way to reach $1,820. Further growth can bring ETH to $1,880 which is the last stop before regaining $2,000.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if Ethereum price fails to surpass $1,780, there could be further correction ahead. In which case, the $1,720 and $1,700 will be the first support levels. The $1,700 is near the 50% Fibonacci retracement level and losing it could be detrimental. Losing this level can bring ETH down to $1,650.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Technical Indicators</strong></h2>



<p>MACD indicator: at the time of writing this article the 1-hour MACD for Ethereum is on an upward movement.</p>



<p>RSI: the relative strength index is currently 50.</p>



<p>Resistance levels: for the bullish run, the $1,780 and $1,820 are absolutely necessary to surpass.</p>



<p>Support levels: at this point, the $1,700 is the crucial support level for ETH.</p>

<p>ADA price climbed as high as $0.60 on August 14 but couldnât break through and backed down. Subsequently, ADA lost the uptrend at $0.55 and entered a red zone. With that, it lost the $0.50 and fell down to $0.4250 on August 29 but found support at that level. At that point, ADA price managed to bounce back and set for recovery then surpassed the $0.45 and $0.50. Yesterday, Cardano regained the $0.52 and $0.53 but failed move any further. Currently, ADA is exchanging hands at $0.52.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><mark style="background-color:#ffffff" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color"><a href="https://blog.hi.exchange/exchange-cryptocurrency-to-paypal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Exchange Cryptocurrency to PayPal</a> Instantly on CoinCannon</mark></p></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>ADA Price Action Analysis</strong></h2>



<p>Taking a look at the 4-hour chart, we see ADA hitting a strong resistance at $0.60 and turning back down. By losing the $0.50 on August 26, Cardano fell as low as $0.4250 but found solid support at this level. Consequently, the price had a breather and managed to bounce back and move as high as $0.53.</p>



<p>At the moment, the $0.53 is the first resistance level for Cardano followed by $0.55 on a downtrend. In case of breaking this trendline and stabilizing above it, ADA can climb as high as $0.60 and $0.65.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if ADA price fails to surpass $0.53, there will be further correction. For the bearish scenario, the $0.48 on the SMA100 is the first support level. After that, the $0.45 will be the next support level. Further decline can bring ADA down to $0.43 and $0.4250.</p>

<p>BNB price faced strong resistance at $340 on August 11 and had to back down. By losing the $300, $280 and $275 supports, Binance coin fell down to $260 on September 6. Finally, BNB found support at this level and managed to bounce back with a recovery attempt. With that, the price surpassed $275 and $280 and reached $290. Currently, BNB price is at $295 range.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>BNB Price Action Analysis</strong></h2>



<p>Taking a look at the 4-hour chart, we see BNB hitting a dead end at $340 and having to back down. After that, Binance coin formed a downward channel and continued ranging between the top and bottom. On September 6, BNB hit the bottom at $260 and had the chance to bounce back.</p>



<p>Currently, the $300 is the first resistance level for Binance coin. In case of a successful breakthrough, the $310 on top of the channel will be a key resistance level. Following that, the $320, $335 and $340 are the next levels to follow.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if BNB price fails to surpass $295 to $300 range, we can expect deeper correction. For the bearish scenario, the $280 near the SMA100 will be the next support level. Further decline can bring BNB down to $270, $260 and $255.</p>

<p>DOGE price touched the $0.090 on August 16 but faced rejection and headed for a correction. With that, DOGE lost the $0.075 and $0.065 support levels and settled on $0.060 on September 1.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>DOGE Price Action Analysis</strong></h2>



<p>Taking a look at the 4-hour chart, we see DOGE inside a new upward channel. Consequently, DOGE reached the ceiling on August 16 at $0.090 and got rejected then fell down to $0.060.</p>



<p>Currently, the $0.060 is a key support level for Dogecoin. In case of providing good support, DOGE can bounce back and recover. For that, the $0.065 on the 50% Fibonacci retracement level will be the key resistance level for the price. After that, the $0.070, $0.075 and $0.080 are the next resistance levels.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if DOGE price fails to surpass $0.065 and loses the $0.060, we can expect further decline. For the bearish scenario, the $0.058, $0.055 and $0.050 will be the following support levels.</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Ethereum is hovering above the $1,520 and $1,500 support levels.</li><li>Currently, Ether is trading above the $1,550 level and the 1-hour candles are above the SMA100.</li><li>In case ETH remains above $1,550 level, it could form a new rally.</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Ethereum Price Action Analysis</strong></h2>



<p>Ethereum finally gained some positive momentum and surpassed $1,620 as well as the SMA100. Despite that, ETH failed to hold above $1,620 and hit a 24-hour high of $1,648 before having a correction. With that, ETH lost the $1,580 and $1,550 and reached a 24-hour low of $1,535. Then, the buyers attempted to set Ethereum for recovery and bring it back above 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level from the latest fall from $1,648 to $1,535. Currently, the price is below $1,535 and the 1-hour candles are above the SMA100. On the 1-hour chart, we see a new uptrend forming with support level at $1,560.</p>



<p>The first resistance level for Ethereum is at $1,600 which is near the 50% Fibonacci retracement level. Following that, the $1,620 and $1,650 will be the next resistance levels. Further growth can pave the way for ETH to reach $1,700.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if Ethereum price fails to surpass $1,600, there could be a new downtrend. In that case, the $1,560 will be a key support level right on the SMA100. Then, the $1,530 and $1,500 will come next to hold the decline. In case of failure, ETH could fall as low as $1,420.</p>

<p>ADA price had set on a rally starting from August 13 and reached $0.60. However, it failed to surpass this critical level and had to bac down. With that, Cardano broke the uptrend at $0.55 and lost it. Furthermore, ADA price lost the $0.50 support level and fell down to $0.44 on August 22. At that point, the price found support and bounced back with a recovery attempt. Yet again, Cardano failed to move above $0.48 and dipped back down to $0.42. Currently, ADA is trading at $0.43.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><mark style="background-color:#ffffff" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color"><a href="https://blog.hi.exchange/exchange-cryptocurrency-to-paypal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Exchange Cryptocurrency to PayPal</a> Instantly on CoinCannon</mark></p></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>ADA Price Action Analysis</strong></h2>



<p>Taking a look at the 4-hour chart, we see ADA managed to reach $0.60 on August 4 riding on an uptrend. However, it hit a strong ceiling at the price and had to back down. Subsequently, Cardano entered a bearish zone by losing the $0.55 and fell as low as $0.42. Once again, it got support at this level.</p>



<p>At the moment, the $0.42 is the key support level for ADA. In case of providing strong support, we can expect a new recovery attempt. For that, the $0.45 located on the SMA100 is the first resistance level for ADA. Following that, the $0.50 on the 50% Fibonacci retracement level will come next. Then, the $0.55, $0.58 and $0.60 will be the next resistance levels for Cardano.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if ADA price fails to surpass $0.44 and $0.45, and subsequently loses the $0.42, further decline will be imminent. For the bearish scenario, the $0.40 will be the next support level for ADA. Further decline can bring the price down to $0.38 and $0.35.</p>

<p>XRP price grew as high as $0.40 on July 30 but faced strong resistance and backed down. With that, Ripple fell down to $0.35 on August 10 and found support at this level. Despite that, it failed to surpass $0.39 and remained bearish. By losing the $0.35, XRP fell down to $0.33 and yet again found support. Once again, despite the sudden rally to $0.37, Ripple failed to stabilize. Currently, XRP price is at $0.33.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><mark style="background-color:#ffffff" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">Buy and Sell XRP instantly on <a href="http://www.hi.exchange" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jolixo</a><br>No KYC</mark></p></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>XRP Price Action Analysis</strong></h2>



<p>Taking a look at the 4-hour chart, we see XRP touching the ceiling at $0.41 on July 30 and turning back down. Subsequently, Ripple had a downward spiral and fell down to $0.33.</p>



<p>At this point, the $0.33 is the first support level for XRP. In case of providing successful support, we can expect Ripple to set on a new rally. For the bullish scenario, the $0/35 on the SMA100 is the first resistance level for the price. With a breakthrough, the $0.36 on the ceiling of the channel will be the next barrier. After that, Ripple can easily climb up to $0.39.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if XRP price fails to surpass $0.35 and loses the $0.33, further correction will follow. For the bearish scenario, the $0.32 is a key support level. In case of losing this level, the $0.30 will be the next support level for Ripple.</p>
